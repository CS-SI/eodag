    """Plugins API Base plugin

    An Api plugin has three download methods that it must implement:

    - ``query``: search for products
    - ``download``: download a single :class:`~eodag.api.product._product.EOProduct`
    - ``download_all``: download multiple products from a :class:`~eodag.api.search_result.SearchResult`

    The download methods must:

    - download data in the ``outputs_prefix`` folder defined in the plugin's
      configuration or passed through kwargs
    - extract products from their archive (if relevant) if ``extract`` is set to True
      (True by default)
    - save a product in an archive/directory (in ``outputs_prefix``) whose name must be
      the product's ``title`` property
    - update the product's ``location`` attribute once its data is downloaded (and
      eventually after it's extracted) to the product's location given as a file URI
      (e.g. 'file:///tmp/product_folder' on Linux or
      'file:///C:/Users/username/AppData/LOcal/Temp' on Windows)
    - save a *record* file in the directory ``outputs_prefix/.downloaded`` whose name
      is built on the MD5 hash of the product's ``remote_location`` attribute
      (``hashlib.md5(remote_location.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()``) and whose content is
      the product's ``remote_location`` attribute itself.
    - not try to download a product whose ``location``Â attribute already points to an
      existing file/directory
    - not try to download a product if its *record* file exists as long as the expected
      product's file/directory. If the *record* file only is found, it must be deleted
      (it certainly indicates that the download didn't complete)
