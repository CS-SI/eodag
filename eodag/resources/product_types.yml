    they were taken from nadir view. The MCD43A4 product contains 16 days of data provided in a level-3 gridded data
    set in Sinusoidal projection. Both Terra and Aqua data are used in the generation of this product, providing the
    highest probability for quality assurance input data. It is designated with a shortname beginning with MCD, which
    is used to refer to 'combined' products, those comprised of data using both Terra and Aqua.

    resolution and is available from the naip-analytic Amazon S3 bucket as 4-band (RGB + NIR) imagery in MRF format.
    NAIP data is delivered at the state level; every year, a number of states receive updates, with an overall update
    cycle of two or three years. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with
    a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP
    imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

S1_SAR_OCN:
  abstract: |
    Level-2 OCN products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with ERS and ASAR WV
    and two new components: Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
    The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum and includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction
    per swell spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap mode, there are multiple
    spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.
    The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface
    derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.
    The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated
    geometrical Doppler.

S1_SAR_GRD:
  abstract: |
    Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and
    projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has
    approximately square spatial resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at the cost of worse
    spatial resolution.
    GRD products can be in one of three resolutions:
      Full Resolution (FR),
      High Resolution (HR),
      Medium Resolution (MR).
    The resolution is dependent upon the amount of multi-looking performed. Level-1 GRD products are available in MR
    and HR for IW and EW modes, MR for WV mode and MR, HR and FR for SM mode.

    using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project the image in cartographic geometry. Per-pixel radiometric
    measurements are provided in Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances along with the parameters to transform them
    into radiances. Level-1C products are resampled with a constant Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 10, 20 and 60
    meters depending on the native resolution of the different spectral bands. In Level-1C  products, pixel
    coordinates refer to the upper left corner of the pixel. Level-1C products will additionally include Cloud Masks
    and ECMWF data (total column of ozone, total column of water vapour and mean sea level pressure).
