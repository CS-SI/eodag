S1_SAR_OCN:
  abstract: |
    Level-2 OCN products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with ERS and ASAR WV
    and two new components: Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
    The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum and includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction
    per swell spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap mode, there are multiple
    spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.
    The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface
    derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.
    The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated
    geometrical Doppler.

    The TROPOMI instrument is a space-borne, nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the
    ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument, the single payload of the Sentinel-5P spacecraft, uses
    passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar
    radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. The instrument operates in a push-broom configuration
    (non-scanning), with a swath width of ~2600 km on the Earth's surface. The typical pixel size (near nadir) will
    be 7x3.5 km2 for all spectral bands, with the exception of the UV1 band (7x28 km2) and SWIR bands (7x7 km2).

    shortwave infrared (SWIR). The spectrometers for UV, UVIS and NIR are jointly referred to as UVN. Radiation for the

    Sentinel-5 Precursor Level 1B Radiances for spectral band 5.
    TROPOMI utilises a single telescope to form an image of the target area onto a rectangular slit that acts as the
    entrance slit of the spectrometer system. There are four different spectrometers, each with its own optics and
    detector: mediumwave ultraviolet (UV), longwave ultraviolet combined with visible (UVIS), near infrared (NIR), and
    shortwave infrared (SWIR). The spectrometers for UV, UVIS and NIR are jointly referred to as UVN. Radiation for the
    SWIR spectrometer is transferred by an optical relay part in the UVN system from the telescope to an interface
    position (the pupil stop) for the SWIR spectrometer. This is done because of the more stringent thermal requirements
    on the SWIR part of the instrument.
    Each of the detectors is divided in two halves, which yields a total of eight spectral bands.

    Ozone is also an important greenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change.

    ozone absorption is very small. UVAI can also be calculated in the presence of clouds so that daily, global coverage
    is possible. This is ideal for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks, volcanic ash,
    and biomass burning.

S5P_L2_O3_PR:

    Retrieved ozone profiles are used to monitor the evolution of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. Such monitoring
    is important as the ozone layer protects life on Earth against harmful UV radiation. The ozone layer is recovering
    from depletion due to manmade Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Tropospheric ozone is toxic and it plays an important role
    in tropospheric chemistry. Also, ozone is a greenhouse gas and is therefore also relevant for climate change.
    The main parameters in the file are the retrieved ozone profile at 33 levels and the retrieved sub-columns of ozone
    in 6 layers. In addition, the total ozone column and tropospheric ozone columns are provided. For the ozone profile,
    the precision and smoothing errors, the a-priori profile and the averaging kernel are also provided.

S5P_L2_O3_TCL:
  abstract: |
    Ozone in the tropical troposphere plays various important roles. The intense UV radiation and high humidity in the
    tropics stimulate the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH) by the photolysis of ozone. OH is the most important
    oxidant in the troposphere because it reacts with virtually all trace gases, such as CO, CH4 and other hydrocarbons.
    The tropics are also characterized by large emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and
    hydrocarbons, both from natural and anthropogenic sources. Ozone that is formed over regions where large amounts of
    these ozone precursors are emitted, can be transported over great distances and affects areas far from the source.
    The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product is a level-2c product that represents three day averaged tropospheric ozone
    columns on a 0.5° by 1° latitude-longitude grid for the tropical region between 20°N and 20°S. The TROPOMI
    tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level-2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as input.

    The TROPOMI Aerosol Layer Height product focuses on retrieval of vertically localised aerosol layers in the free

    retrieved for cloud-free conditions. Height information for aerosols in the free troposphere is particularly
    important for aviation safety. Scientific applications include radiative forcing studies, long-range transport
    modelling and studies of cloud formation processes. Aerosol height information also helps to interpret the UV
    Aerosol Index (UVAI) in terms of aerosol absorption as the index is strongly height-dependent.

S5P_L2_HCHO:

    Formaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds
    (NMVOC), leading eventually to CO2. NMVOCs are, together with NOx, CO and CH4, among the most important precursors
    of tropospheric O3. The major HCHO source in the remote atmosphere is CH4 oxidation. Over the continents, the
    oxidation of higher NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important and
    localised enhancements of the HCHO levels.
    In addition to the main product results, such as HCHO slant column, vertical column and air mass factor, the level 2
    data files contain several additional parameters and diagnostic information.

S5P_L2_CH4:
  abstract: |
    Methane (CH4) is, after carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important contributor to the anthropogenically enhanced
    greenhouse effect. Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such it is important to
    continue the record of satellite-based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high
    sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatio/temporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse
    modelling of sources and sinks.
    The output product consists of the retrieved methane column and a row vector referred to as the column averaging
    kernel A. The column averaging kernel describes how the retrieved column relates to the true profile and should be
    used in validation exercises (when possible) or use of the product in source/sink inverse modelling. The output
    product also contains altitude levels of the layer interfaces to which the column averaging kernel corresponds.
    Additional output for Level-2 data products: viewing geometry, precision of retrieved methane, residuals of the fit,
    quality flags (cloudiness, terrain roughness etc.) and retrieved albedo and aerosol properties. The latter
    properties are required for a posteriori filtering and for estimation of total retrieval error.
    The Sentinel-5 Precursor mission flies in loose formation (about 3.5 - 5 minutes behind) with the S-NPP
    (SUOMI-National Polar-orbiting Partnership) mission to use VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) cloud

  abstract: |
    This is a reprocessed dataset at baseline F06, which is continued by the NRT/NTC data stream from 29/April/2022
    onwards. The level-2 high resolution products contain the typical altimetry measurements, like the altimeter range,
    the sea surface height, the wind speed, significant wave height and all required geophysical corrections and related
    flags derived either from RAW or RMC, or the combination of both. Two measurement data files are available
    (standard and reduced), each with a different number of variables. The standard data file includes 1 Hz and 20 Hz
    measurements for the Ku- band as well as geophysical corrections at 1 Hz and some at 20 Hz. The reduced data file
    contains only 1 Hz measurements for the Ku- and C-bands as well as geophysical corrections at 1 Hz. Note that the
    HR data products only contain Ku-band measurements. These products are suitable for users seeking information on
    sea state and those creating downstream added value products from multiple altimeters. Particularly for those
    seeking the highest resolution measurements. Sentinel-6 is part of a series of Sentinel satellites, under the
    umbrella of the EU Copernicus programme. It is a collaborative Copernicus mission, implemented and co-funded by the
    European Commission, ESA, EUMETSAT and the USA, through NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

CAMS_GAC_FORECAST:
  abstract: |
    CAMS produces global forecasts for atmospheric composition twice a day.
    The forecasts consist of more than 50 chemical species (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and seven different types of aerosol (desert dust, sea salt, organic matter, black carbon, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium aerosol).
    In addition, several meteorological variables are available as well.
    The initial conditions of each forecast are obtained by combining a previous forecast with current satellite observations through a process called data assimilation.
    This best estimate of the state of the atmosphere at the initial forecast time step, called the analysis, provides a globally complete and consistent dataset allowing for estimates at locations where observation data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available.
    The forecast itself uses a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry to determine the evolution of the concentrations of all species over time for the next five days.
    Apart from the required initial state, it also uses inventory-based or observation-based emission estimates as a boundary condition at the surface.
    The CAMS global forecasting system is upgraded about once a year resulting in technical and scientific changes.
    The horizontal or vertical resolution can change, new species can be added, and more generally the accuracy of the forecasts can be improved.
    Details of these system changes can be found in the documentation.
    Users looking for a more consistent long-term data set should consider using the CAMS Global Reanalysis instead, which is available through the ADS and spans the period from 2003 onwards.
    Finally, because some meteorological fields in the forecast do not fall within the general CAMS data licence, they are only available with a delay of 5 days.

CAMS_EU_AIR_QUALITY_FORECAST:
  abstract: |
    This dataset provides daily air quality analyses and forecasts for Europe.
    CAMS produces specific daily air quality analyses and forecasts for the European domain at significantly higher spatial resolution (0.1 degrees, approx. 10km) than is available from the global analyses and forecasts.
    The production is based on an ensemble of eleven air quality forecasting systems across Europe.
    A median ensemble is calculated from individual outputs, since ensemble products yield on average better performance than the individual model products.
    The spread between the eleven models are used to provide an estimate of the forecast uncertainty.
    The analysis combines model data with observations provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) into a complete and consistent dataset using various data assimilation techniques depending upon the air-quality forecasting system used.
    In parallel, air quality forecasts are produced once a day for the next four days.
    Both the analysis and the forecast are available at hourly time steps at seven height levels.
    Note that only nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, PM2.5, PM10 and dust are regularly validated against in situ observations, and therefore forecasts of all other variables are unvalidated and should be considered experimental.

CAMS_GFE_GFAS:
  abstract: |
    Emissions of atmospheric pollutants from biomass burning and vegetation fires are key drivers of the evolution of atmospheric composition, with a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and an accurate representation of them in models is essential.
    The CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) utilises satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to provide near-real-time information on the location, relative intensity and estimated emissions from biomass burning and vegetation fires.
    Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions.
    Emissions estimates for 40 pyrogenic species are available from GFAS, including aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees longitude by 0.1 degrees latitude.
    This version of GFAS (v1.2) provides daily averaged data based on a combination of FRP observations from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, one on the NASA EOS-Terra satellite and the other on the NASA EOS-Aqua satellite from 1 January 2003 to present. GFAS also provides daily estimates of smoke plume injection heights derived from FRP observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts from ECMWF.
    GFAS data have been used to provide surface boundary conditions for the CAMS global atmospheric composition and European regional air quality forecasts, and the wider atmospheric chemistry modelling community.

CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION:
  abstract: |
    The CAMS solar radiation services provide historical values (2004 to present) of global (GHI), direct (BHI) and diffuse (DHI) solar irradiation, as well as direct normal irradiation (BNI).
    The aim is to fulfil the needs of European and national policy development and the requirements of both commercial and public downstream services, e.g. for planning, monitoring, efficiency improvements and the integration of solar energy systems into energy supply grids.
    For clear-sky conditions, an irradiation time series is provided for any location in the world using information on aerosol, ozone and water vapour from the CAMS global forecasting system.
    Other properties, such as ground albedo and ground elevation, are also taken into account.
    Similar time series are available for cloudy (or "all sky") conditions but, since the high-resolution cloud information is directly inferred from satellite observations, these are currently only available inside the field-of-view of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, which is roughly Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and the Middle East.
    Data is offered in both ASCII and netCDF format.
    Additionally, an ASCII "expert mode" format can be selected which contains in addition to the irradiation, all the input data used in their calculation (aerosol optical properties, water vapour concentration, etc).
    This additional information is only meaningful in the time frame at which the calculation is performed and so is only available at 1-minute time steps in universal time (UT).

CAMS_GREENHOUSE_INVERSION:
  abstract: |
    This data set contains net fluxes at the surface, atmospheric mixing ratios at model levels, and column-mean atmospheric mixing ratios for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20).
    Natural and anthropogenic surface fluxes of greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of Earth’s climate, so their monitoring is essential.
    Such information has been used in particular as part of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
    Ground-based and satellite remote-sensing observations provide a means to quantifying the net fluxes between the land and ocean on the one hand and the atmosphere on the other hand.
    This is done through a process called atmospheric inversion, which uses transport models of the atmosphere to link the observed concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the net fluxes at the Earth's surface.
    By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades.
    For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields).
    The data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency.
    This is reflected by the different version numbers. In addition, fluxes for methane are available based on surface air samples only or based on a combination of surface air samples and satellite observations (reflected by an 's' in the version number).

CAMS_EAC4_MONTHLY:
  abstract: |
    EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) is the fourth generation ECMWF global reanalysis of atmospheric composition.
    Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry.
    This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued.
    Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade.
    Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.
    The assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data.
    The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available.
    The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.
    The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates.
    For this reason, EAC4 is only available from 2003 onwards.
    Although the analysis procedure considers chunks of data in a window of 12 hours in one go, EAC4 provides estimates every 3 hours, worldwide.
    This is made possible by the 4D-Var assimilation method, which takes account of the exact timing of the observations and model evolution within the assimilation window.

CAMS_EU_AIR_QUALITY_RE:

    CAMS produces annual air quality (interim) reanalyses for the European domain at significantly higher spatial resolution (0.1 degrees, approx. 10km) than is available from the global reanalyses.
    The production is currently based on an ensemble of nine air quality data assimilation systems across Europe. A median ensemble is calculated from individual outputs, since ensemble products yield on average better performance than the individual model products.
    The spread between the nine models can be used to provide an estimate of the analysis uncertainty.
    The reanalysis combines model data with observations provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) into a complete and consistent dataset using various data assimilation techniques depending upon the air-quality forecasting system used.
    Additional sources of observations can complement the in-situ data assimilation, like satellite data.
    An interim reanalysis is provided each year for the year before based on the unvalidated near-real-time observation data stream that has not undergone full quality control by the data providers yet.
    Once the fully quality-controlled observations are available from the data provider, typically with an additional delay of about 1 year, a final validated annual reanalysis is provided.
    Both reanalyses are available at hourly time steps at height levels.

CAMS_GRF_AUX:
  abstract: |
    This dataset provides aerosol optical depths and aerosol-radiation radiative effects for four different aerosol origins: anthropogenic, mineral dust, marine, and land-based fine-mode natural aerosol.
    The latter mostly consists of biogenic aerosols.
    The data are a necessary complement to the "CAMS global radiative forcings" dataset (see "Related Data").
    The calculation of aerosol radiative forcing requires a discrimination between aerosol of anthropogenic and natural origin.
    However, the CAMS reanalysis, which is used to provide the aerosol concentrations, does not make this distinction.
    The anthropogenic fraction was therefore derived by a method which uses aerosol size as a proxy for aerosol origin.

CAMS_GRF:
  abstract: |
    This dataset provides geographical distributions of the radiative forcing (RF) by key atmospheric constituents.
    The radiative forcing estimates are based on the CAMS reanalysis and additional model simulations and are provided separately for CO2 CH4, O3 (tropospheric and stratospheric), interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and radiation and interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and clouds.
    Radiative forcing measures the imbalance in the Earth's energy budget caused by a perturbation of the climate system, such as changes in atmospheric composition caused by human activities.
    RF is a useful predictor of globally-averaged temperature change, especially when rapid adjustments of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are taken into account.
    RF has therefore become a quantitative metric to compare the potential climate response to different perturbations.
    Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the industrial era exerted a positive RF, causing a gain of energy in the climate system.
    In contrast, concurrent changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations are thought to exert a negative RF leading to a loss of energy.
    Products are quantified both in "all-sky" conditions, meaning that the radiative effects of clouds are included in the radiative transfer calculations, and in "clear-sky" conditions, which are computed by excluding clouds in the radiative transfer calculations.
    The upgrade from version 1.5 to 2 consists of an extension of the period by 2017-2018, the addition of an "effective radiative forcing" product and new ways to calculate the pre-industrial reference state for aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei.
    More details are given in the documentation section.
    New versions may be released in future as scientific methods develop, and existing versions may be extended with later years if data for the period is available from the CAMS reanalysis.
    Newer versions supercede old versions so it is always recommended to use the latest one.
    CAMS also produces distributions of aerosol optical depths, distinguishing natural from anthropogenic aerosols, which are a separate dataset. See "Related Data".

CAMS_GLOBAL_EMISSIONS:
  abstract: |
    This data set contains gridded distributions of global anthropogenic and natural emissions.
    Natural and anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of the composition of the atmosphere, so an accurate representation of them in forecast models of atmospheric composition is essential.
    CAMS compiles inventories of emission data that serve as input to its own forecast models, but which can also be used by other atmospheric chemical transport models.
    These inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use on land, shipping, and aviation, and natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean and termites.
    The anthropogenic emissions on land are further separated in specific activity sectors (e.g., power generation, road traffic, industry).
    The CAMS emission data sets provide good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors.
    Because most inventory-based data sets are only available with a delay of several years, the CAMS emission inventories also extend these existing data sets forward in time by using the trends from the most recent available years, producing timely input data for real-time forecast models.
    Most of the data sets are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency, when needed. This is reflected by the different version numbers.

ERA5_SL:
  abstract: |
    ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades.
    Data is available from 1940 onwards. ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model
    data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the
    laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical
    weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined
    with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the
    atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the
    same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades.
    Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect
    observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of
    the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly
    estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty
    estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and
    spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the
    information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They
    also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean
    averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean
    and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are
    detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release
    2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified. The data set presented here is a
    regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which
    should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.
    Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees
    for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub
    sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels
    (atmospheric,ocean-wave and land surface quantities).

ERA5_LAND:
  abstract: |
    ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several
    decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of
    the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a
    globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several
    decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land uses as input to
    control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is
    called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can
    rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land,
    they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input
    air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference
    between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate
    correction'. The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of
    uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes
    governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go
    back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower.
    ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields.
    The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface
    applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period
    covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers,
    businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states. Variables in the
    dataset/application are: 10m u-component of wind, 10m v-component of wind, 2m dewpoint temperature, 2m temperature,

UERRA_EUROPE_SL:
  abstract: |
    This UERRA dataset contains analyses of surface and near-surface essential climate variables from UERRA-HARMONIE
    and MESCAN-SURFEX systems. Forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available
    only through the CDS-API (see Documentation). UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system,
    while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN
    provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidit
    at 2 meters above the model topography. The land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields
    from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis
    performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows to take full benefit
    of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as
    surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.
    In general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data
    from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of
    estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format,
    makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over
    time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in
    1960s, will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates. The improvement over global
    reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details
    (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation
    networks. Variables in the dataset/application are: 10m wind direction, 10m wind speed, 2m relative humidity, 2m

    A glacier is defined as a perennial mass of ice, and possibly firn and snow, originating on the land surface
    from the recrystallization of snow or other forms of solid precipitation and showing evidence of past or
    present flow. There are several types of glaciers such as glacierets, mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and
    ice fields, as well as ice caps. Some glacier tongues reach into lakes or the sea, and can develop floating
    ice tongues or ice shelves. Glacier changes are recognized as independent and high-confidence natural
    indicators of climate change. Past, current and future glacier changes affect global sea level, the regional
    water cycle and local hazards.\nThis dataset is a snapshot of global glacier outlines compiled from\nmaps,
    aerial photographs and satellite images mostly acquired in the period 2000-2010.

SATELLITE_CARBON_DIOXIDE:
  abstract: |
    This dataset provides observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)\namounts obtained from observations
    collected by several current and historical \nsatellite instruments. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring
    Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value
    of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels,
    deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily
    due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide
    abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally
    resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the
    measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be
    identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged
    carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse
    the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is
    referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by
    applying several algorithms to different satellite \ninstruments. Typically, different algorithms have
    different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically
    depends on the application.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios
    of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns.  The XCO2 products have been retrieved from
    SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and OCO-2. The mid-tropospheric CO2 product has been retrieved from the
    IASI instruments on-board the Metop satellite series and from AIRS. \nThe XCO2 products are available as Level
    2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available
    as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: BESD and WFMD algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP and SRFP algorithms) and as a
    multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCO2 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. \nThe IASI
    and AIRS products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on
    a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to
    one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY and
    AIRS L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA)
    Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole
    fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)

    by human activities, primarily because of agricultural emissions (e.g., rice production, ruminants) and fossil
    fuel production and use. A clear annual cycle is largely due to seasonal wetland emissions.\nAtmospheric
    methane abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally
    resolved near-infrared and infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the
    measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from methane and constituent gasses can be identified. It is
    through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged methane abundance
    in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and
    determine the methane concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm.
    For this dataset, methane abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite
    instruments.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CH4, denoted
    XCH4 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CH4 columns. \nThe XCH4 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and
    TANSO-FTS/GOSAT. The mid-tropospheric CH4 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments onboard the
    Metop satellite series. The XCH4 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and
    as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: WFMD
    and IMAP algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP, OCPR, SRFP and SRPR algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA
    algorithm). The L3 XCH4 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. The IASI products are available as L2 products
    generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding
    (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is
    produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY L2 products that were generated in the framework
    of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the
    dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric methane (XCH4), Mid-tropospheric
    columns of atmospheric methane (CH4)

SEASONAL_POSTPROCESSED_PL:
  abstract: |
    This entry covers pressure-level data post-processed for bias adjustment on a monthly time resolution.
    \nSeasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks
    or months, as a result of predictable changes in some of the slow-varying components of the system. For
    example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact
    on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and
    remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all
    long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise
    detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the
    future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise
    changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large
    uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast
    products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual
    components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as
    many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the
    atmosphere, ocean and land surface. These models are initialised with data describing the state of the system
    at the starting point of the forecast, and used to predict the evolution of this state in time.\nWhile
    uncertainties coming from imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions of the components of the Earth system
    can be described with the use of ensembles, uncertainty arising from approximations made in the models are
    very much dependent on the choice of model. A convenient way to quantify the effect of these approximations
    is to combine outputs from several models, independently developed, initialised and operated.\nTo this effect,
    the C3S provides a multi-system seasonal forecast service, where data produced by state-of-the-art seasonal
    forecast systems developed, implemented and operated at forecast centres in several European countries is
    collected, processed and combined to enable user-relevant applications. The composition of the C3S seasonal
    multi-system and the full content of the database underpinning the service are described in the documentation.
    The data is grouped in several catalogue entries (CDS datasets), currently defined by the type of variable
    (single-level or multi-level, on pressure surfaces) and the level of post-processing applied (data at original
    time resolution, processing on temporal aggregation and post-processing related to bias adjustment).\nThe

SATELLITE_SEA_LEVEL_BLACK_SEA:
  abstract: |
    Sea level anomaly is the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. Up-to-date
    altimeter standards are used to estimate the sea level anomalies with a mapping algorithm dedicated to the
    Black sea region. Anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012).
    The steady number of reference satellite used in the production of this dataset contributes to the long-term
    stability of the sea level record. Improvements of the accuracy, sampling of meso-scale processes and of the
    high-latitude coverage were achieved by using a few additional satellite missions. New data are provided with
    a delay of about 4-5 months relatively to near-real time or interim sea level products. This delay is mainly
    due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process.
    However, this processing and validation adds stability and accuracy to the sea level variables and make them
    adapted to climate applications. This dataset includes uncertainties for each grid cell. More details about
    the sea level retrieval, additional filters, optimisation procedures, and the error estimation are given in
    the Documentation section. Variables in the dataset/application are: Absolute dynamic topography, Absolute
    geostrophic velocity meridian component, Absolute geostrophic velocity zonal component, Geostrophic velocity
    anomalies meridian component, Geostrophic velocity anomalies zonal component, Sea level anomaly

    This dataset provides precipitation and near surface air temperature for Europe as Essential Climate
    Variables (ECVs) and as a set of Climate Impact Indicators (CIIs) based on the ECVs. \nECV datasets
    provide the empirical evidence needed to understand the current climate and predict future changes.
    \nCIIs contain condensed climate information which facilitate relatively quick and efficient subsequent
    analysis. Therefore, CIIs make climate information accessible to application focussed users within a
    sector.\nThe ECVs and CIIs provided here were derived within the water management sectoral information
    service to address questions specific to the water sector. However, the products are provided in a generic
    form and are relevant for a range of sectors, for example agriculture and energy.\nThe data represent
    the current state-of-the-art in Europe for regional climate modelling and indicator production. Data
    from eight model simulations included in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)
    were used to calculate a total of two ECVs and five CIIs at a spatial resolution of 0.11° x 0.11° and 5km
    x 5km.\nThe ECV data meet the technical specification set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS),
    as such they are provided on a daily time step. They are bias adjusted using the EFAS gridded observations
    as a reference dataset. Note these are model output data, not observation data as is the general case for
    ECVs.\nThe CIIs are provided as mean values over a 30-year time period. For the reference period
    (1971-2000) data is provided as absolute values, for the future periods the data is provided as absolute
    values and as the relative or absolute change from the reference period. The future periods cover 3 fixed
    time periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100) and 3 \"degree scenario\" periods defined by when global
    warming exceeds a given threshold (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C or 3.0 °C). The global warming is calculated from the
    global climate model (GCM) used, therefore the actual time period of the degree scenarios will be different
    for each GCM.\nThis dataset is produced and quality assured by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological
    Institute on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. \n\nVariables in the dataset/application
    are:\n2m air temperature, Highest 5-day precipitation amount, Longest dry spells, Number of dry spells,

    This data set provides complete historical reconstruction of meteorological conditions favourable to the start,
    spread and sustainability of fires. The fire danger metrics provided are part of a vast dataset produced by the
    Copernicus Emergency Management Service for the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). The European
    Forest Fire Information System incorporates the fire danger indices for three different models developed in Canada,
    United States and Australia. In this dataset the fire danger indices are calculated using weather forecast from
    historical simulations provided by ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. ERA5 by combining model data and a vast set of quality
    controlled observations provides a globally complete and consistent data-set and is regarded as a good proxy for
    observed atmospheric conditions. The selected data records in this data set are regularly extended with time as
    ERA5 forcing data become available. This dataset is produced by ECMWF in its role of the computational centre for
    fire danger forecast of the CEMS, on behalf of the Joint Research Centre which is the managing entity of the service.
    Variables in the dataset/application are: Build-up index, Burning index, Danger rating, Drought code, Duff moisture
    code, Energy release component, Fine fuel moisture code, Fire daily severity index, Fire danger index, Fire weather
    index, Ignition component, Initial spread index, Keetch-Byram drought index, Spread component

    This dataset provides a gridded modelled time series of river discharge, forced with medium-

    key hydrological variable across the global domain, and is a product of the Global Flood Awareness
    System (GloFAS). It is accompanied by an ancillary file for interpretation that provides the
    upstream area (see the related variables table and associated link in the documentation).\nThis
    dataset was produced by forcing a hydrological modelling chain with input from the European
    Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 11-member ensemble ECMWF-ENS reforecasts.
    Reforecasts are forecasts run over past dates, and those presented here are used for providing
    a suitably long time period against which the skill of the 30-day real-time operational forecast
    can be assessed. The reforecasts are initialised twice weekly with lead times up to 46 days, at
    24-hour steps for 20 years in the recent history. For more specific information on the how the
    reforecast dataset is produced we refer to the documentation.\nCompanion datasets, also available
    through the Climate Data Store (CDS), are the operational forecasts, historical simulations that
    can be used to derive the hydrological climatology, and seasonal forecasts and reforecasts for
    users looking for long term forecasts. For users looking specifically for European hydrological
    data, we refer to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) forecasts and historical simulations.

    runoff forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 51-member
    ensemble seasonal forecasting system, SEAS5. The forecasts are initialised on the first of each

    the Climate Data Store (CDS), are the operational forecasts, historical simulations that can be used
    to derive the hydrological climatology, and medium-range and seasonal reforecasts. The latter dataset
    enables research, local skill assessment and post-processing of the seasonal forecasts. In addition,
    the seasonal reforecasts are also used to derive a specific range dependent climatology for the
    seasonal system. For users looking specifically for European hydrological data, we refer to the

    The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) inventory was initiated in 1985 (reference year 1990). Updates have been produced in
    2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018. It consists of an inventory of land cover in 44 classes. CLC uses a Minimum Mapping
    Unit (MMU) of 25 hectares (ha) for areal phenomena and a minimum width of 100 m for linear phenomena. The time
    series are complemented by change layers, which highlight changes in land cover with an MMU of 5 ha. Different
    MMUs mean that the change layer has higher resolution than the status layer. Due to differences in MMUs the
    difference between two status layers will not equal to the corresponding CLC-Changes layer. If you are interested
    in CLC-Changes between two neighbour surveys always use the CLC-Change layer.

CLMS_GLO_NDVI_1KM_LTS:
  abstract: |
    The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a proxy to quantify the vegetation amount. It is defined
    as NDVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red) where NIR corresponds to the reflectance in the near infrared band, and Red to the
    reflectance in the red band. The time series of dekadal (10-daily) NDVI 1km version 2 observations over the
    period 1999-2017 is used to calculate Long Term Statistics (LTS) for each of the 36 10-daily periods (dekads)
    of the year. The calculated LTS include the minimum, median, maximum, average, standard deviation and the number
    of observations in the covered time series period. These LTS can be used as a reference for actual NDVI observations,
    which allows evaluating whether vegetation conditions deviate from a 'normal' situation.

CLMS_GLO_DMP_333M:
  abstract: |
    Dry matter Productivity (DMP) is an indication of the overall growth rate or dry biomass increase of the vegetation
    and is directly related to ecosystem Net Primary Productivity (NPP), however its units (kilograms of gross dry
    matter per hectare per day) are customized for agro-statistical purposes. Compared to the Gross DMP (GDMP), or its
    equivalent Gross Primary Productivity, the main difference lies in the inclusion of the autotrophic respiration.
    Like the FAPAR products that are used as input for the GDMP estimation, these GDMP products are provided in Near
    Real Time, with consolidations in the next periods, or as offline product.

    Gross dry matter Productivity (GDMP) is an indication of the overall growth rate or dry biomass increase of the
    vegetation and is directly related to ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), that reflects the ecosystem's
    overall production of organic compounds from atmospheric carbon dioxide, however its units (kilograms of gross dry
    matter per hectare per day) are customized for agro-statistical purposes. Like the FAPAR products that are used as

CLMS_GLO_LAI_333M:
  abstract: |
    LAI was defined by CEOS as half the developed area of the convex hull wrapping the green canopy elements per unit
    horizontal ground. This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems.
    LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations
    will be scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation,
    it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers. This is particularly important for forest canopies where
    the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds
    therefore to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory. The product at
    333m resolution is provided in Near Real Time and consolidated in the next six periods.

CLMS_GLO_FAPAR_333M:
  abstract: |
    The FAPAR quantifies the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed by plants for photosynthesis. It refers only to
    the green and living elements of the canopy. The FAPAR depends on the canopy structure, vegetation element optical
    properties, atmospheric conditions and angular configuration. To overcome this latter dependency, a daily integrated
    FAPAR value is assessed. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models and is recognized
    as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). The product at 333m resolution
    is provided in Near Real Time and consolidated in the next six periods.

EEA_DAILY_SWI_1KM:
  abstract: |
    The Soil Water Index (SWI) quantifies the moisture condition at various depths in the soil. It is mainly driven by
    the precipitation via the process of infiltration. Soil moisture is a very heterogeneous variable and varies on
    small scales with soil properties and drainage patterns. Satellite measurements integrate over relative large-scale
    areas, with the presence of vegetation adding complexity to the interpretation. Soil moisture is a key parameter in
    numerous environmental studies including hydrology, meteorology and agriculture, and is recognized as an Essential
    Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). The SWI product provides daily information about
    moisture conditions in different soil layers. It includes a quality flag (QFLAG) indicating the availability of SSM
    measurements for SWI calculations, and a Surface State Flag (SSF) indicating frozen or snow covered soils.

EEA_DAILY_SSM_1KM:
  abstract: |
    Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is the relative water content of the top few centimetres soil, describing how wet or
    dry the soil is in its topmost layer, expressed in percent saturation. It is measured by satellite radar sensors and
    allows insights in local precipitation impacts and soil conditions. SSM is a key driver of water and heat fluxes
    between the ground and the atmosphere, regulating air temperature and humidity. Moreover, in its role as water supply,
    it is vital to vegetation health. Vice versa, SSM is very sensitive to external forcing in the form of precipitation,
    temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, and wind. SSM is thus both an integrator of climatic conditions and a driver
    of local weather and climate, and plays a major role in global water-, energy- and carbon- cycles. Knowledge on the
    dynamics of soil moisture is important in the understanding of processes in many environmental and socio-economic fields,
    e.g., its impact on vegetation vitality, crop yield, droughts or exposure to flood threats.

EEA_DAILY_VI:
  abstract: |
    Vegetation Indices (VI) comprises four daily vegetation indices (PPI, NDVI, LAI and FAPAR) and quality information,
    that are part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) HR-VPP product suite. The 10m resolution, daily updated
    Plant Phenology Index (PPI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed
    Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) are derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite observations. They are
    provided together with a related quality indicator (QFLAG2) that flags clouds, shadows, snow, open water and other areas
    where the VI retrieval is less reliable. These Vegetation Indices are made available as a set of raster files with 10 x 10m
    resolution, in UTM/WGS84 projection corresponding to the Sentinel-2 tiling grid, for those tiles that cover the EEA38
    countries and the United Kingdom and for the period from 2017 until today, with daily updates. The Vegetation Indices
    are part of the pan-European High Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity (HR-VPP) component of the Copernicus
    Land Monitoring Service (CLMS).
