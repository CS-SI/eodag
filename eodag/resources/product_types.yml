    NAIP data is delivered at the state level; every year, a number of states receive updates, with an overall update
    cycle of two or three years. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with
    a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP
    imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

S1_SAR_OCN:
  abstract: |
    Level-2 OCN products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with ERS and ASAR WV
    and two new components: Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
    The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum and includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction
    per swell spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap mode, there are multiple
    spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.
    The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface
    derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.
    The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated
    geometrical Doppler.

    Solar irradiance spectra for the SWIR bands (band 7 and band 8).
    TROPOMI utilises a single telescope to form an image of the target area onto a rectangular slit that acts as the
    entrance slit of the spectrometer system. There are four different spectrometers, each with its own optics and
    detector: mediumwave ultraviolet (UV), longwave ultraviolet combined with visible (UVIS), near infrared (NIR), and
    shortwave infrared (SWIR). The spectrometers for UV, UVIS and NIR are jointly referred to as UVN. Radiation for the
    SWIR spectrometer is transferred by an optical relay part in the UVN system from the telescope to an interface
    position (the pupil stop) for the SWIR spectrometer. This is done because of the more stringent thermal requirements
    on the SWIR part of the instrument.
    Each of the detectors is divided in two halves, which yields a total of eight spectral bands.

    from depletion due to manmade Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Tropospheric ozone is toxic and it plays an important role
    in tropospheric chemistry. Also, ozone is a greenhouse gas and is therefore also relevant for climate change.
    The main parameters in the file are the retrieved ozone profile at 33 levels and the retrieved sub-columns of ozone
    in 6 layers. In addition, the total ozone column and tropospheric ozone columns are provided. For the ozone profile,

S5P_L2_O3_TCL:
  abstract: |
    Ozone in the tropical troposphere plays various important roles. The intense UV radiation and high humidity in the
    tropics stimulate the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH) by the photolysis of ozone. OH is the most important
    oxidant in the troposphere because it reacts with virtually all trace gases, such as CO, CH4 and other hydrocarbons.
    The tropics are also characterized by large emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and
    hydrocarbons, both from natural and anthropogenic sources. Ozone that is formed over regions where large amounts of
    these ozone precursors are emitted, can be transported over great distances and affects areas far from the source.
    The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product is a level-2c product that represents three day averaged tropospheric ozone
    columns on a 0.5° by 1° latitude-longitude grid for the tropical region between 20°N and 20°S. The TROPOMI
    tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level-2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as input.

    important for aviation safety. Scientific applications include radiative forcing studies, long-range transport
    modelling and studies of cloud formation processes. Aerosol height information also helps to interpret the UV
    Aerosol Index (UVAI) in terms of aerosol absorption as the index is strongly height-dependent.

    Formaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds

    of tropospheric O3. The major HCHO source in the remote atmosphere is CH4 oxidation. Over the continents, the
    oxidation of higher NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important and
    localised enhancements of the HCHO levels.
    In addition to the main product results, such as HCHO slant column, vertical column and air mass factor, the level 2

S5P_L2_CH4:
  abstract: |
    Methane (CH4) is, after carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important contributor to the anthropogenically enhanced
    greenhouse effect. Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such it is important to
    continue the record of satellite-based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high
    sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatio/temporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse
    modelling of sources and sinks.
    The output product consists of the retrieved methane column and a row vector referred to as the column averaging
    kernel A. The column averaging kernel describes how the retrieved column relates to the true profile and should be
    used in validation exercises (when possible) or use of the product in source/sink inverse modelling. The output
    product also contains altitude levels of the layer interfaces to which the column averaging kernel corresponds.
    Additional output for Level-2 data products: viewing geometry, precision of retrieved methane, residuals of the fit,
    quality flags (cloudiness, terrain roughness etc.) and retrieved albedo and aerosol properties. The latter
    properties are required for a posteriori filtering and for estimation of total retrieval error.
    The Sentinel-5 Precursor mission flies in loose formation (about 3.5 - 5 minutes behind) with the S-NPP
    (SUOMI-National Polar-orbiting Partnership) mission to use VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) cloud

    The S5P level 2 methane product is dependent on having information on cloud occurrence at spatial resolution finer
    than that achievable from TROPOMI itself. This information is also useful for other purposes, including assessing
    the influence of cloud on other L2 products and issues related to spatial co-registration. A level 2 auxiliary
    product was therefore developed to describe cloud in the TROPOMI field of view (FOV), using co-located observations
    of VIIRS (Visible Infra-red Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the U.S. S-NPP (Suomi - National Polar-orbiting
    Partnership). S5P flies in a so-called loose formation with the S-NPP with a temporal separation between them of
    less than 5 minutes.
    The main information contained in the S5P-NPP product is:
    1. A statistical summary for each S5P FOV of the NPP-VIIRS L2 Cloud Mask (VCM).
    2. The mean and standard deviation of the sun-normalised radiance in a number of VIIRS moderate resolution bands.
    This information is provided for three S5P spectral bands (to account for differences in spatial sampling).

    the influence of cloud on other L2 products and issues related to spatial co-registration. A level 2 auxiliary
    product was therefore developed to describe cloud in the TROPOMI field of view (FOV), using co-located observations
    of VIIRS (Visible Infra-red Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the U.S. S-NPP (Suomi - National Polar-orbiting
    Partnership). S5P flies in a so-called loose formation with the S-NPP with a temporal separation between them of
    less than 5 minutes.
    The main information contained in the S5P-NPP product is:
    1. A statistical summary for each S5P FOV of the NPP-VIIRS L2 Cloud Mask (VCM).
    2. The mean and standard deviation of the sun-normalised radiance in a number of VIIRS moderate resolution bands.
    This information is provided for three S5P spectral bands (to account for differences in spatial sampling).

S5P_L2_SO2:
  abstract: |
    Sulphur dioxide (SO2) enters the Earth's atmosphere through both natural (~30%) and anthropogenic processes (~70%).
    It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global scale and its impact ranges from short term pollution to effects
    on climate.
    Beside the total column of SO2, enhanced levels of SO2 are flagged within the products. The recognition of enhanced
    SO2 values is essential in order to detect and monitor volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic pollution sources.
    Volcanic SO2 emissions may also pose a threat to aviation, along with volcanic ash.
