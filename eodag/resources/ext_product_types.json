The Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) data in this collection is a radiometrically terrain corrected product derived from the [Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-1-grd) products produced by the European Space Agency. The RTC processing is performed by [Catalyst](https://catalyst.earth/).\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction accounts for terrain variations that affect both the position of a given point on the Earth's surface and the brightness of the radar return, as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover-induced backscatter differences. Additionally, comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning.\n\nA Planetary Computer account is required to retrieve SAS tokens to read the RTC data. See the [documentation](http://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/#when-an-account-is-needed) for more information.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe Sentinel-1 GRD product is converted to calibrated intensity using the conversion algorithm described in the ESA technical note ESA-EOPG-CSCOP-TN-0002, [Radiometric Calibration of S-1 Level-1 Products Generated by the S-1 IPF](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/S1-Radiometric-Calibration-V1.0.pdf). The flat earth calibration values for gamma correction (i.e. perpendicular to the radar line of sight) are extracted from the GRD metadata. The calibration coefficients are applied as a two-dimensional correction in range (by sample number) and azimuth (by time). All available polarizations are calibrated and written as separate layers of a single file. The calibrated SAR output is reprojected to nominal map orientation with north at the top and west to the left.\n\nThe data is then radiometrically terrain corrected using PlanetDEM as the elevation source. The correction algorithm is nominally based upon D. Small, [\u201cFlattening Gamma: Radiometric Terrain Correction for SAR Imagery\u201d](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/2011_Flattening_Gamma.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol 49, No 8., August 2011, pp 3081-3093. For each image scan line, the digital elevation model is interpolated to determine the elevation corresponding to the position associated with the known near slant range distance and arc length for each input pixel. The elevations at the four corners of each pixel are estimated using bilinear resampling. The four elevations are divided into two triangular facets and reprojected onto the plane perpendicular to the radar line of sight to provide an estimate of the area illuminated by the radar for each earth flattened pixel. The uncalibrated sum at each earth flattened pixel is normalized by dividing by the flat earth surface area. The adjustment for gamma intensity is given by dividing the normalized result by the cosine of the incident angle. Pixels which are not illuminated by the radar due to the viewing geometry are flagged as shadow.\n\nCalibrated data is then orthorectified to the appropriate UTM projection. The orthorectified output maintains the original sample sizes (in range and azimuth) and was not shifted to any specific grid.\n\nRTC data is processed only for the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which is the main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements.\n", "instrument": null, "platform": "Sentinel-1", "platformSerialIdentifier": "SENTINEL-1A,SENTINEL-1B", "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "c-band,copernicus,esa,rtc,sar,sentinel,sentinel-1,sentinel-1-rtc,sentinel-1a,sentinel-1b", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "title": "Sentinel 1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC)", "missionStartDate": "2014-10-10T00:28:21Z"}, "gridmet": {"abstract": "gridMET is a dataset of daily surface meteorological data at approximately four-kilometer resolution, covering the contiguous U.S. from 1979 to the present.

The operational GOES-R Satellites, GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18, capture 16-band imagery from geostationary orbits over the Western Hemisphere via the Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) radiometer. The ABI captures 2 visible, 4 near-infrared, and 10 infrared channels at resolutions between 0.5km and 2km.\n\n### Geographic coverage\n\nThe ABI captures three levels of coverage, each at a different temporal cadence depending on the modes described below. The geographic coverage for each image is described by the `goes:image-type` STAC Item property.\n\n- _FULL DISK_: a circular image depicting nearly full coverage of the Western Hemisphere.\n- _CONUS_: a 3,000 (lat) by 5,000 (lon) km rectangular image depicting the Continental U.S. (GOES-16) or the Pacific Ocean including Hawaii (GOES-17).\n- _MESOSCALE_: a 1,000 by 1,000 km rectangular image. GOES-16 and 17 both alternate between two different mesoscale geographic regions.\n\n### Modes\n\nThere are three standard scanning modes for the ABI instrument: Mode 3, Mode 4, and Mode 6.\n\n- Mode _3_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, three observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and thirty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every fifteen minutes.\n- Mode _4_ consists of the observation of the full disk scene every five minutes.\n- Mode _6_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, two observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and twenty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every ten minutes.\n\nThe mode that each image was captured with is described by the `goes:mode` STAC Item property.\n\nSee this [ABI Scan Mode Demonstration](https://youtu.be/_c5H6R-M0s8) video for an idea of how the ABI scans multiple geographic regions over time.\n\n### Cloud and Moisture Imagery\n\nThe Cloud and Moisture Imagery product contains one or more images with pixel values identifying \"brightness values\" that are scaled to support visual analysis.  Cloud and Moisture Imagery product (CMIP) files are generated for each of the sixteen ABI reflective and emissive bands. In addition, there is a multi-band product file that includes the imagery at all bands (MCMIP).\n\nThe Planetary Computer STAC Collection `goes-cmi` captures both the CMIP and MCMIP product files into individual STAC Items for each observation from a GOES-R satellite. It contains the original CMIP and MCMIP NetCDF files, as well as cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) exports of the data from each MCMIP band (2km); the full-resolution CMIP band for bands 1, 2, 3, and 5; and a Web Mercator COG of bands 1, 2 and 3, which are useful for rendering.\n\nThis product is not in a standard coordinate reference system (CRS), which can cause issues with some tooling that does not handle non-standard large geographic regions.\n\n### For more information\n- [Beginner\u2019s Guide to GOES-R Series Data](https://www.goes-r.gov/downloads/resources/documents/Beginners_Guide_to_GOES-R_Series_Data.pdf)\n- [GOES-R Series Product Definition and Users\u2019 Guide: Volume 5 (Level 2A+ Products)](https://www.goes-r.gov/products/docs/PUG-L2+-vol5.pdf) ([Spanish verison](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/raw/main/GOES/QuickGuides/Spanish/Guia%20introductoria%20para%20datos%20de%20la%20serie%20GOES-R%20V1.1%20FINAL2%20-%20Copy.pdf))\n\n", "instrument": "ABI", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": "GOES-16,GOES-17,GOES-18", "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "abi,cloud,goes,goes-16,goes-17,goes-18,goes-cmi,moisture,nasa,noaa,satellite", "license": "proprietary", "title": "GOES-R Cloud & Moisture Imagery", "missionStartDate": "2017-02-28T00:16:52Z"}, "terraclimate": {"abstract": "[TerraClimate](http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html) is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958 to the present.

The attenuation factor simulates the dampening of the flood levels due to the roughness over land.\n\nIn its current version, the model does not account for varying roughness over land and permanent water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and it does not account for the compound effects of waves, rainfall, and river discharge on coastal flooding.

The horizontal axis shows *forecast times* in 3-hour intervals out from the reference time. A black square over a particular forecast time, or step, indicates that a forecast is made for that forecast time, for that particular `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time` combination.\n\n* **stream** is the forecasting system that produced the data. The values are available in the `ecmwf:stream` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `enfo`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), atmospheric fields\n  * `mmsf`: [multi-model seasonal forecasts](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast) fields from the ECMWF model only.\n  * `oper`: [high-resolution forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast), atmospheric fields \n  * `scda`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, atmospheric fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\")\n  * `scwv`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, ocean wave fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\") and\n  * `waef`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), ocean wave fields,\n  * `wave`: wave model\n* **type** is the forecast type.

The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:type`: The forecast type (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:step`: The offset from the reference datetime, expressed as `<value><unit>`, for example `\"3h\"` means \"3 hours from the reference datetime\". \n* `ecmwf:reference_datetime`: The datetime when the model was run. This indicates when the forecast *was made*, rather than when it's valid for.\n* `ecmwf:forecast_datetime`: The datetime for which the forecast is valid.

The CDL is a crop-specific land cover classification product of more than 100 crop categories grown in the United States. CDLs are derived using a supervised land cover classification of satellite imagery. The supervised classification relies on first manually identifying pixels within certain images, often called training sites, which represent the same crop or land cover type. Using these training sites, a spectral signature is developed for each crop type that is then used by the analysis software to identify all other pixels in the satellite image representing the same crop. Using this method, a new CDL is compiled annually and released to the public a few months after the end of the growing season.\n\nThis collection includes Cropland, Confidence, Cultivated, and Frequency products.\n\n- Cropland: Crop-specific land cover data created annually.

This can be \"1901-2000\", \"1991-2020\", or \"2006-2020\".\n* `noaa_climate_normals:frequency`: Climate normal temporal interval (frequency). This can be \"daily\", \"monthly\", \"seasonal\" , or \"annual\"\n* `noaa_climate_normals:time_index`: Time step index, e.g., month of year (1-12).\n\nThe `description` field of the assets varies by frequency. Using `prcp_norm` as an example, the descriptions are\n\n* annual: \"Annual precipitation normals from monthly precipitation normal values\"\n* seasonal: \"Seasonal precipitation normals (WSSF) from monthly normals\"\n* monthly: \"Monthly precipitation normals from monthly precipitation values\"\n* daily: \"Precipitation normals from daily averages\"\n\nCheck the assets on individual items for the appropriate description.\n\nThe STAC keys for most assets consist of two abbreviations.

The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n* [Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY SA 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 179MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-SA-40]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax` for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations in the above table include all three variables.\n\n[^2]: The institution which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived.

Each map is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year.\n\nThis dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/), who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification. The global map was produced by applying this model to the Sentinel-2 annual scene collections on the Planetary Computer. Each of the maps has an assessed average accuracy of over 75%.\n\nThis map uses an updated model from the [10-class model](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-lulc) and combines Grass(formerly class 3) and Scrub (formerly class 6) into a single Rangeland class (class 11). The original Esri 2020 Land Cover collection uses 10 classes (Grass and Scrub separate) and an older version of the underlying deep learning model.  The Esri 2020 Land Cover map was also produced by Impact Observatory.  The map remains available for use in existing applications.

Yet, these maps are often years out of date by the time they are available to scientists and policy-makers. The datasets in this STAC Collection build on past studies that map Biodiversity Intactness using the [PREDICTS database](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2579) of spatially referenced observations of biodiversity across 32,000 sites from over 750 studies. The approach differs from previous work by modeling the relationship between observed biodiversity metrics and contemporary, global, geospatial layers of human pressures, with the intention of providing a high resolution monitoring product into the future.\n\nBiodiversity intactness is estimated as a combination of two metrics: Abundance, the quantity of individuals, and Compositional Similarity, how similar the composition of species is to an intact baseline. Linear mixed effects models are fit to estimate the predictive capacity of spatial datasets of human pressures on each of these metrics and project results spatially across the globe. These methods, as well as comparisons to other leading datasets and guidance on interpreting results, are further explained in a methods [white paper](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/io-biodiversity/Biodiversity_Intactness_whitepaper.pdf) entitled \u201cGlobal 100m Projections of Biodiversity Intactness for the years 2017-2020.\u201d\n\nAll years are available under a Creative Commons BY-4.0 license.\n", "instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "biodiversity,global,io-biodiversity", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "title": "Biodiversity Intactness", "missionStartDate": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z"}, "naip": {"abstract": "The [National Agriculture Imagery Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) (NAIP) provides U.S.-wide, high-resolution aerial imagery, with four spectral bands (R, G, B, IR).

The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available.

Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but was relicensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) in March, 2023. \n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org) provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`) corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\n\n## Accessing the data\n\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax` for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations in the above table include all three variables.\n\n[^2]: The institution which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but was relicensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) in March, 2023. \n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

Polygonization \u2013 Converting building pixel detections into polygons\n\n**Stage 1: Semantic Segmentation**\n\n![Semantic segmentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints/main/images/segmentation.jpg)\n\n**Stage 2: Polygonization**\n\n![Polygonization](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints/raw/main/images/polygonization.jpg)\n\n## Data assets\n\nThe building footprints are provided as a set of [geoparquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet) datasets in [Delta][delta] table format.\nThe data are partitioned by\n\n1. Region\n2. quadkey at [Bing Map Tiles][tiles] level 9\n\nEach `(Region, quadkey)` pair will have one or more geoparquet files, depending on the density of the of the buildings in that area.\n\nNote that older items in this dataset are *not* spatially partitioned. We recommend using data with a processing date\nof 2023-04-25 or newer. This processing date is part of the URL for each parquet file and is captured in the STAC metadata\nfor each item (see below).\n\n## Delta Format\n\nThe collection-level asset under the `delta` key gives you the fsspec-style URL\nto the Delta table. This can be used to efficiently query for matching partitions\nby `Region` and `quadkey`. See the notebook for an example using Python.\n\n## STAC metadata\n\nThis STAC collection has one STAC item per region. The `msbuildings:region`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific region, and the `msbuildings:quadkey`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific quadkey (though you can also search\nby the `geometry`).\n\nNote that older STAC items are not spatially partitioned. We recommend filtering on\nitems with an `msbuildings:processing-date` of `2023-04-25` or newer. See the collection\nsummary for `msbuildings:processing-date` for a list of valid values.\n\n[delta]: https://delta.io/\n[tiles]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system\n", "instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "bing-maps,buildings,delta,footprint,geoparquet,microsoft,ms-buildings", "license": "ODbL-1.0", "title": "Microsoft Building Footprints", "missionStartDate": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z"}, "sentinel-3-slstr-frp-l2-netcdf": {"abstract": "This Collection provides Sentinel-3 [SLSTR Level-2 Fire Radiative Power](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/product-types/level-2-frp) (FRP) products containing data on fires detected over land and ocean.\n\n## Data files\n\nThe primary measurement data is contained in the `FRP_in.nc` file and provides FRP and uncertainties, projected onto a 1km grid, for fires detected in the thermal infrared (TIR) spectrum over land. Since February 2022, FRP and uncertainties are also provided for fires detected in the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum over both land and ocean, with the delivered data projected onto a 500m grid. The latter SWIR-detected fire data is only available for night-time measurements and is contained in the `FRP_an.nc` or `FRP_bn.nc` files.\n\nIn addition to the measurement data files, a standard set of annotation data files provide meteorological information, geolocation and time coordinates, geometry information, and quality flags.\n\n## Processing\n\nThe TIR fire detection is based on measurements from the S7 and F1 bands of the [SLSTR instrument](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/instrument); SWIR fire detection is based on the S5 and S6 bands.
