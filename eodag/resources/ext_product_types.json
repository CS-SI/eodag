Sea ice concentration is the fractional coverage of an ocean area covered with sea ice. Daily sea ice extent values are computed from the daily sea ice concentration maps. All sea ice covering the Baltic Sea is included, except for lake ice. The data used to produce the charts are Synthetic Aperture Radar images as well as in situ observations from ice breakers (Uiboupin et al., 2010). The annual course of the sea ice extent has been calculated as daily mean ice extent for each day-of-year over the period October 1992 \u2013 September 2014. Weekly smoothed time series of the sea ice extent have been calculated from daily values using a 7-day moving average filter.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice coverage has a vital role in the annual course of physical and ecological conditions in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it is an important parameter for safe winter navigation. The presence of sea ice cover sets special requirements for navigation, both for the construction of the ships and their behavior in ice, as in many cases, merchant ships need icebreaker assistance. Temporal trends of the sea ice extent could be a valuable indicator of the climate change signal in the Baltic Sea region. It has been estimated that a 1 \u00b0C increase in the average air temperature results in the retreat of ice-covered area in the Baltic Sea about 45,000 km2 (Granskog et al., 2006). Decrease in maximum ice extent may influence vertical stratification of the Baltic Sea (Hordoir and Meier, 2012) and affect the onset of the spring bloom (Eilola et al., 2013). In addition, statistical sea ice coverage information is crucial for planning of coastal and offshore construction. Therefore, the knowledge about ice conditions and their variability is required and monitored in Copernicus Marine Service.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSea ice coverage in the Baltic Sea is strongly seasonal. In general, sea ice starts to form in October and may last until June. The ice season 2021/22 had relatively low maximum ice extent in the Baltic Sea. Sea ice extent reached a maximum area of about 65 000 km2. Sea ice started to form already in November, then reached the value of 60 000 km2 at the beginning of January, but then stopped to increase and even decreased slightly. Maximum sea ice extent was observed at the beginning of February. Afterwards, the sea ice extent slowly withdrew, while in average winters the sea ice increased until the end of February. In a case of fully ice covered Baltic Sea the maximum ice extent is 422 000 km2, which was last observed during the 1940s (Vihma and Haapala, 2009). Thus, 15% of the Baltic Sea was covered by ice in 2021/22. Although there is a tendency of decreasing sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea over the period 1993-2022, the linear trend is not statistically significant.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\n(a) Time series of day-of-year average sea ice extent derived from remote sensing and in situ observations ((http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/oceanografi/havsis, Uiboupin et al., 2010).

Spawning stock biomasses of the Baltic cod have gone through a steep decline in the late 1980s (Bryhn et al., 2022). Water salinity and oxygen concentration affect cod stock through the survival of eggs (Westin and Nissling, 1991; Wieland et al., 1994). Major Baltic Inflows provide a suitable environment for cod reproduction by bringing saline oxygenated water to the deep basins of the Baltic Sea (see the OMIs: BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm and BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland). Increased cod reproductive volume has a positive effect on cod reproduction success, which should reflect an increase of stock size indicator 4\u20135 years after the Major Baltic Inflow (Raudsepp et al., 2019). Eastern Baltic cod reaches maturity around age 2\u20133, depending on the population density and environmental conditions. There are a number of environmental factors affecting cod populations (Bryhn et al., 2022). Low oxygen and salinity cause stress, which negatively affects cod recruitment, whereas sufficient conditions may bring about male cod maturation even at the age of 1.5 years (Cardinale and Modin, 1999; Karasiova et al., 2008). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn general, the cod reproductive volume fluctuates between 200 and 400 km3. There are two separate periods when cod reproductive volume has significantly increased where maximum values reach 1200 km3. These periods, from 2003 to 2005 and from 2015 to 2018, correspond to the post Major Baltic Inflow periods (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm and BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland). In 2022, the cod reproductive volume was at its base level between 200 and 400 km3. According to the study by Bryhn et al. (2022) an increase of spawning stock biomass in the eastern Baltic Sea has not been observed.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nThe time series of cod reproductive volume in the Baltic Sea from 1993 to 2022.

The salinity trend has been obtained through a linear fit for each time series of horizontally averaged (13 \u00b0E - 31 \u00b0E and 53 \u00b0N - 66 \u00b0N; excluding the Skagerrak strait) annual salinity and at each depth level.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a brackish semi-enclosed sea in North-Eastern Europe. The surface salinity varies horizontally from ~10 near the Danish Straits down to ~2 at the northernmost and easternmost sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The halocline, a vertical layer with rapid changes of salinity with depth that separates the well-mixed surface layer from the weakly stratified layer below, is located at the depth range of 60-80 metres (Matth\u00e4us, 1984). The bottom layer salinity below the halocline depth varies from 15 in the south down to 3 in the northern Baltic Sea (V\u00e4li et al., 2013). The long-term salinity is determined by net precipitation and river discharge as well as saline water inflows from the North Sea (Lehmann et al., 2022). Long-term salinity decrease may reduce the occurrence and biomass of the Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica association/symbiotic aggregations (Kotta et al., 2019). Changes in salinity and oxygen content affect the survival of the Baltic cod eggs (Raudsepp et al, 2019; von Dewitz et al., 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe subsurface salinity over the 1993-2022 period shows a positive trend in the entire depth range. The salinity trend is practically negligible in the upper mixed layer of the sea. Then increases monotonically from 0.01 to 0.04 per year within the extended halocline layer between 40-120 m. The salinity trend is almost constant of 0.04-0.05 in the deep layer. In the halocline and in the deep layer, i.e. at the depth range between 60 and 250 metres the confidence interval of the trend values is wide, which indicates that this depth range is relatively dynamic.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nThe vertical profile of horizontally averaged subsurface salinity trends for period of 1993-2022.

(1) The oxygen penetration depth is the depth at which  [O2] < 20\u00b5M, expressed in [m]. (2) The oxygen penetration density is the potential density anomaly at the oxygen penetration depth [kg/m\u00b3]. (3) The oxygen inventory is the vertically integrated oxygen content [mol O2/m\u00b2]. The 20\u00b5M threshold was chosen to minimize the indicator sensitivity to sensor\u2019s precision. Those three metrics are complementary: Oxygen penetration depth is more easily understood, but present more spatial variability. Oxygen penetration density helps in dissociating biogeochemical processes from shifts in the physical structure. Although less intuitive, the oxygen inventory is a more integrative diagnostic and its definition is more easily transposed to other areas.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Black Sea is permanently stratified, due to the contrast in density between large riverine and Mediterranean inflows. This stratification restrains the ventilation of intermediate and deep waters and confines, within a restricted surface layer, the waters that are oxygenated by photosynthesis and exchanges with the atmosphere. The vertical extent of the oxic layer determines the volume of habitat available for pelagic populations (Ostrovskii and Zatsepin 2011, Sak\u0131nan and G\u00fcc\u00fc 2017) and present spatial and temporal variations (Murray et al. 1989; Tugrul et al. 1992; Konovalov and Murray 2001). At long and mid-term, these variations can be monitored with three metrics (Capet et al. 2016), derived from the vertical profiles that can obtained from traditional ship casts or autonomous Argo profilers (Stanev et al., 2013). A large source of uncertainty associated with the spatial and temporal average of those metrics stems from the small number of Argo floats, scarcely adequate to sample the known spatial variability of those metrics.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring the past 60 years, the vertical extent of the Black Sea oxygenated layer has narrowed from 140m to 90m (Capet et al. 2016). The Argo profilers active for 2016 suggested an ongoing deoxygenation trend and indicated an average oxygen penetration depth of 72m at the end of 2016, the lowest value recorded during the past 60 years. The oxygenation of subsurface water is closely related to the intensity of cold water formation, an annual ventilation processes which has been recently limited by warmer-than-usual winter air temperature (Capet et al. 2020). In 2017, 2018 and 2020, cold waters formation resulted in a partial reoxygenation of the intermediate layer. Yet, such ventilation has been lacking in winter 2020-2021, and the updated 2021 indicators reveals the lowest oxygen inventory ever reported in this OMI time series. This results in significant detrimental trends now depicted also over the Argo period (2012-2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00213\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capet, A., Vandenbulcke, L., & Gr\u00e9goire, M.

Globally, it impacts ecosystems, precipitation, and freshwater resources (Glantz, 2001). ENSO is mainly characterized by two anomalous states that last from several months to more than a year and recur irregularly on a typical time scale of 2-7 years. The warm phase El Ni\u00f1o is broadly characterized by a weakening of the easterly trade winds at interannual timescales associated with surface and subsurface processes leading to a surface warming in the eastern Pacific. Opposite changes are observed during the cold phase La Ni\u00f1a (review in Wang et al., 2017). Nino 3.4 sub-surface Temperature Anomaly is a good indicator of the state of the Central tropical Pacific el Nino conditions and enable to monitor the evolution the ENSO phase.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS **\n\nOver the 1993-2017 period, there were several episodes of strong positive ENSO (el nino) phases in particular during the 1997/1998 winter and the 2015/2016 winter, where NINO3.4 indicator reached positive values larger than 2\u00b0C (and remained above 0.5\u00b0C during more than 6 months). Several La Nina events were also observed like during the 1998/1999 winter and during the 2010/2011 winter. \nThe NINO34 subsurface indicator is a good index to monitor the state of ENSO phase and a useful tool to help seasonal forecasting of atmospheric conditions.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n'\"\"REFERENCES'''\n\n\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00220\n\n**References:**\n\n* Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report.

This OMI is derived from the CMEMS Reprocessed Black Sea L4 SST satellite product (SST_BS_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_022, see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-BLKSEA-SST.pdf), which provided the SSTs used to compute the evolution of SST anomalies (unfiltered and filtered) over the Black Sea.

The reference for this OMI can be found in the first and second issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report (OSR), Section 1.1 (Roquet et al., 2016; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). In the last decades, since the availability of satellite data (beginning of 1980s), the Black Sea has experienced a warming trend in SST (see e.g. Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2010; Mulet et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring 2022, the Black Sea basin average SST anomaly was ~0.6 \u00b0C above the 1993-2014 climatology, slightly higher than that of previous year (~0.5 \u00b0C). The Black Sea SST monthly anomalies ranged between -1.0/+1.0 \u00b0C. The highest temperature anomaly (~1.6 \u00b0C) was reached in December 2022, while the lowest (~-0.07 \u00b0C) in April. This year, along with 2021, was characterized by milder temperature anomalies with respect to the previous three consecutive years (2018-2020) marked by peaks of ~3 \u00b0C occurred in May 2018, June 2019, and October 2020.\nOver the period 1993-2022, the Black Sea SST has warmed at a rate of 0.070 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b0C/year, which corresponds to an average increase of about 2 \u00b0C during these last 30 years. The picture of the trend seems to maintain a decreasing tendency since recent years.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of monthly mean (blue line) and 24-month filtered (red line) sea surface temperature anomalies in the Black Sea during the period 1993-2022. Anomalies are relative to the climatological period 1993-2014 and built from the CMEMS SST_BS_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_022 satellite product (see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-BLKSEA-SST.pdf). The sea surface temperature trend with its 95% confidence interval (shown in the box) is estimated by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005) and Sen\u2019s method (Sen 1968).

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004) and the Analysis product (MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_006_013).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1987-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Near Real Time product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the Essential Ocean Variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. In recent decades (from mid \u201880s) the Mediterranean Sea showed a trend of increasing temperatures (Ducrocq et al., 2016), which has been observed also by means of the CMEMS SST_MED_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_021 satellite product and reported in the following CMEMS OMI: MEDSEA_OMI_TEMPSAL_sst_area_averaged_anomalies and MEDSEA_OMI_TEMPSAL_sst_trend.\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a semi-enclosed sea characterized by an annual average surface temperature which varies horizontally from ~14\u00b0C in the Northwestern part of the basin to ~23\u00b0C in the Southeastern areas. Large-scale temperature variations in the upper layers are mainly related to the heat exchange with the atmosphere and surrounding oceanic regions. The Mediterranean Sea annual 99th percentile presents a significant interannual and multidecadal variability with a significant increase starting from the 80\u2019s as shown in Marb\u00e0 et al. (2015) which is also in good agreement with the multidecadal change of the mean SST reported in Mariotti et al. (2012). Moreover the spatial variability of the SST 99th percentile shows large differences at regional scale (Darmariaki et al., 2019; Pastor et al. 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Mediterranean mean Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile evaluated in the period 1987-2019 (upper panel) presents highest values (~ 28-30 \u00b0C) in the eastern Mediterranean-Levantine basin and along the Tunisian coasts especially in the area of the Gulf of Gabes, while the lowest (~ 23\u201325 \u00b0C) are found in the Gulf of Lyon (a deep water formation area), in the Alboran Sea (affected by incoming Atlantic waters) and the eastern part of the Aegean Sea (an upwelling region). These results are in agreement with previous findings in Darmariaki et al. (2019) and Pastor et al. (2018) and are consistent with the ones presented in CMEMS OSR3 (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019) for the period 1993-2016.\nThe 2020      Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile anomaly map (bottom panel) shows a general positive pattern up to +3\u00b0C in the North-West Mediterranean area while colder anomalies are visible in the Gulf of Lion      and North Aegean Sea     . This Ocean Monitoring Indicator confirms the continuous warming of the SST and in particular it shows that the year 2020      is characterized by an overall increase of the extreme Sea Surface Temperature values in almost the whole domain with respect to the reference period. This finding can be probably affected      by the different dataset used to evaluate this anomaly map: the 2020      Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile derived from the Near Real Time Analysis product compared to the mean (1987-2019) Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile evaluated from the      Reanalysis product which, among the others, is characterized by different atmospheric forcing).\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00266\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

Spatial averaging was weighted by surface area. Monthly mean values are given here. The reference period is 1993-2014. El Nino or La Nina events are defined when the NINO3.4 SST anomalies exceed +/- 0.5\u00b0C during a period of six month.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nEl Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most  important source of climatic  variability resulting  from a strong coupling between ocean and atmosphere in the central tropical Pacific and affecting surrounding populations.  Globally, it impacts ecosystems, precipitation, and freshwater resources (Glantz, 2001). ENSO is mainly characterized by two anomalous states that last from several months to more than a year and recur irregularly on a typical time scale of 2-7 years. The warm phase El Ni\u00f1o is broadly characterized by a weakening of the easterly trade winds at interannual timescales associated with surface and subsurface processes leading to a surface warming in the eastern Pacific. Opposite changes are observed during the cold phase La Ni\u00f1a (review in Wang et al., 2017). Nino 3.4 Sea surface Temperature Anomaly is a good indicator of the state of the Central tropical Pacific El Nino conditions and enable to monitor the evolution the ENSO phase.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the 1993-2019 period, there were several episodes of strong positive ENSO phases in particular in 1998 and 2016, where NINO3.4 indicator reached positive values larger than 2\u00b0C (and remained above 0.5\u00b0C during more than 6 months). Several La Nina events were also observed like in 2000 and 2008. \nThe NINO34 indicator is a good index to monitor the state of ENSO phase and a useful tool to help seasonal forecasting of meteorological conditions.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00219\n\n**References:**\n\n* Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report.

(2018) and is described and discussed in Good et al. (2020). The processing steps applied were: \n1.\tThe daily analyses were averaged to create monthly means.  \n2.\tA climatology was calculated by averaging the monthly means over the period 1993 - 2014.  \n3.\tMonthly anomalies were calculated by differencing the monthly means and the climatology.  \n4.\tAn area averaged time series was calculated by averaging the monthly fields over the globe, with each grid cell weighted according to its area.  \n5.\tThe time series was passed through the X11 seasonal adjustment procedure, which decomposes the time series into a residual seasonal component, a trend component and errors (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005).

It provides insight into the flow of heat into and out of the ocean, into modes of variability in the ocean and atmosphere, can be used to identify features in the ocean such as fronts and upwelling, and knowledge of SST is also required for applications such as ocean and weather prediction (Roquet et al., 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the period 1993 to 2021, the global average linear trend was 0.015 \u00b1 0.001\u00b0C / year (95% confidence interval). 2021 is nominally the sixth warmest year in the time series. Aside from this trend, variations in the time series can be seen which are associated with changes between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a conditions. For example, peaks in the time series coincide with the strong El Ni\u00f1o events that occurred in 1997/1998 and 2015/2016 (Gasparin et al., 2018).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00242\n\n**References:**\n\n* GCOS.

The reference for this OMI can be found in the first and second issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report (OSR), Section 1.1 (Roquet et al., 2016; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). The Mediterranean Sea is a climate change hotspot (Giorgi F., 2006). Indeed, Mediterranean SST has experienced a continuous warming trend since the beginning of 1980s (e.g., Pisano et al., 2020; Pastor et al., 2020). Specifically, since the beginning of the 21st century (from 2000 onward), the Mediterranean Sea featured the highest SSTs and this warming trend is expected to continue throughout the 21st century (Kirtman et al., 2013). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring 2022, the Mediterranean Sea experienced an unprecedented long-lasting period of intense sea surface temperatures\u2019 warming or, in other words, an exceptional marine heatwave event. The basin average SST anomaly was 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b0C in 2022, well above the value of 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C recorded in 2021. The Mediterranean SST warming started in May 2022, when the mean anomaly increased abruptly from 0.01 \u00b0C (April) to 0.76 \u00b0C (May), reaching the highest values during June (1.66 \u00b0C) and July (1.52 \u00b0C), and persisting until the end of the year with anomalies around 1 \u00b0C above the 1993-2014 climatology. The peak of June 2022 set the record of highest SST anomaly ever recorded since 1993. The 2022 Mediterranean marine heatwave is comparable to that occurred in 2003 (see e.g. Olita et al., 2007) in terms of anomaly magnitude but longer in duration: it lasted about seven months (May-December 2022) compared to the three of 2003 summer event (June-September 2003).\nOver the period 1993-2022, the Mediterranean SST has warmed at a rate of 0.034 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b0C/year, which corresponds to an average increase of about 1 \u00b0C during these last 30 years. Within its error (namely, the 95% confidence interval), this warming trend is consistent with recent trend estimates in the Mediterranean Sea (Pisano et al., 2020; Pastor et al., 2020). However, though the linear trend being constantly increasing during the whole period, the picture of the Mediterranean SST trend in 2022 seems to reveal a restarting after the pause occurred in the last years (since 2015-2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00268\n\n**References:**\n\n* Giorgi, F., 2006.

The processing steps applied were: \n1.\tThe daily analyses were averaged to create monthly means.  \n2.\tA climatology was calculated by averaging the monthly means over the period 1993 - 2014.  \n3.\tMonthly anomalies were calculated by differencing the monthly means and the climatology.  \n4.\tThe time series for each grid cell was passed through the X11 seasonal adjustment procedure, which decomposes a time series into a residual seasonal component, a trend component and errors (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005).

This OMI is derived from the CMEMS Reprocessed Mediterranean L4 SST product (SST_MED_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_021, see also the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-MEDSEA-SST.pdf), which provides the SSTs used to compute the SST trend over the Mediterranean Sea. This reprocessed product consists of daily (nighttime) optimally interpolated 0.05\u00b0 grid resolution SST maps over the Mediterranean Sea built from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Merchant et al., 2019) and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) initiatives, including also an adjusted version of the AVHRR Pathfinder dataset version 5.3 (Saha et al., 2018) to increase the input observation coverage. Trend analysis has been performed by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (see e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005; Pisano et al., 2020), which has the effect of filtering the input SST time series acting as a low bandpass filter for interannual variations. Mann-Kendall test and Sens\u2019s method (Sen 1968) were applied to assess whether there was a monotonic upward or downward trend and to estimate the slope of the trend and its 95% confidence interval. The reference for this OMI can be found in the first and second issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report (OSR), Section 1.1 (Roquet et al., 2016; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterize the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). The Mediterranean Sea is a climate change hotspot (Giorgi F., 2006). Indeed, Mediterranean SST has experienced a continuous warming trend since the beginning of 1980s (e.g., Pisano et al., 2020; Pastor et al., 2020). Specifically, since the beginning of the 21st century (from 2000 onward), the Mediterranean Sea featured the highest SSTs and this warming trend is expected to continue throughout the 21st century (Kirtman et al., 2013).   \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe spatial pattern of the Mediterranean SST trend shows a general warming tendency, ranging from 0.002 \u00b0C/year to 0.063 \u00b0C/year. Overall, a higher SST trend intensity characterizes the Eastern and Central Mediterranean basin with respect to the Western basin. In particular, the Balearic Sea, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas, as well as the northern Ionian and Aegean-Levantine Seas show the highest SST trends (from 0.04 \u00b0C/year to 0.05 \u00b0C/year on average). Trend patterns of warmer intensity characterize some of main sub-basin Mediterranean features, such as the Pelops Anticyclone, the Cretan gyre and the Rhodes Gyre. On the contrary, less intense values characterize the southern Mediterranean Sea (toward the African coast), where the trend attains around 0.025 \u00b0C/year. The SST warming rate spatial change, mostly showing an eastward increase pattern (see, e.g., Pisano et al., 2020, and references therein), i.e. the Levantine basin getting warm faster than the Western, appears now to have tilted more along a North-South direction.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nSea surface temperature cumulative trend over the period 1993-2022 in the Mediterranean Sea. The cumulative trend is the rate of change (\u00b0C/year) scaled by the number of time steps (30 years). The Mediterranean trend map in sea surface temperature is derived from the CMEMS SST_MED_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_021 product (see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-MEDSEA-SST.pdf). The trend is estimated at the 95% confidence interval by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005; Pisano et al., 2020) and Sen\u2019s method (Sen 1968). Grey crosses, rounding the Ierapetra gyre and in proximity of the Strait of Gibraltar, indicate that trend values are not statistically significant (namely, less than 95% c.i.).

The area covers the Baltic Sea including the transition area towards the North Sea (i.e. the Danish Belts, the Kattegat and Skagerrak).\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00011", "providers": [{"name": "FMI (Finland)", "roles": ["producer"]}, {"name": "Copernicus Marine Service", "roles": ["host", "processor"], "url": "https://marine.copernicus.eu"}], "doi": "10.48670/moi-00011"}, "GLOBAL_OMI_TEMPSAL_Tyz_trend": {"instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "change-over-time-in-sea-water-temperature,coastal-marine-environment,global-ocean,global-omi-tempsal-tyz-trend,in-situ-observation,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": "proprietary", "title": "Global Ocean Zonal Mean Subsurface Temperature cumulative trend from Multi-Observations Reprocessing", "missionStartDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z", "abstract": "**DEFINITION**\n\nThe linear change of zonal mean subsurface temperature over the period 1993-2019 at each grid point (in depth and latitude) is evaluated to obtain a global mean depth-latitude plot of subsurface temperature trend, expressed in \u00b0C.\nThe linear change is computed using the slope of the linear regression at each grid point scaled by the number of time steps (27 years, 1993-2019). A multi-product approach is used, meaning that the linear change is first computed for 5 different zonal mean temperature estimates. The average linear change is then computed, as well as the standard deviation between the five linear change computations. The evaluation method relies in the study of the consistency in between the 5 different estimates, which provides a qualitative estimate of the robustness of the indicator. See Mulet et al. (2018) for more details.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nLarge-scale temperature variations in the upper layers are mainly related to the heat exchange with the atmosphere and surrounding oceanic regions, while the deeper ocean temperature in the main thermocline and below varies due to many dynamical forcing mechanisms (Bindoff et al., 2019). Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation (IPCC, 2019), ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in ecosystem assemblages, biodiversity, population extinctions, coral bleaching and infectious disease, change in behavior (including reproduction), as well as redistribution of habitat (e.g. Gattuso et al., 2015, Molinos et al., 2016, Ramirez et al., 2017). Ocean warming also intensifies tropical cyclones (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Trenberth et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2017).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe results show an overall ocean warming of the upper global ocean over the period 1993-2019, particularly in the upper 300m depth. In some areas, this warming signal reaches down to about 800m depth such as for example in the Southern Ocean south of 40\u00b0S. In other areas, the signal-to-noise ratio in the deeper ocean layers is less than two, i.e. the different products used for the ensemble mean show weak agreement. However, interannual-to-decadal fluctuations are superposed on the warming signal, and can interfere with the warming trend. For example, in the subpolar North Atlantic decadal variations such as the so called \u2018cold event\u2019 prevail (Dubois et al., 2018; Gourrion et al., 2018), and the cumulative trend over a quarter of a decade does not exceed twice the noise level below about 100m depth.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00244\n\n**References:**\n\n* Dubois, C., K. von Schuckmann, S.

The Major Baltic Inflows occur seldom, sometimes many years apart (Mohrholz, 2018). The Major Baltic Inflow OMI consists of the time series of the bottom layer salinity in the Arkona basin and in the Bornholm basin and the time-depth plot of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the Gotland basin (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland). Bottom salinity increase in the Arkona basin is the first indication of the saline water inflow, but not necessarily Major Baltic Inflow. Abrupt increase of bottom salinity of 2-3 units in the more downstream Bornholm basin is a solid indicator that Major Baltic Inflow has occurred.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a huge brackish water basin in Northern Europe whose salinity is controlled by its freshwater budget and by the water exchange with the North Sea (e.g. Neumann et al., 2017). The saline and oxygenated water inflows to the Baltic Sea through the Danish straits, especially the Major Baltic Inflows, occur only intermittently (e.g. Mohrholz, 2018). Long-lasting periods of oxygen depletion in the deep layers of the central Baltic Sea accompanied by a salinity decline and the overall weakening of vertical stratification are referred to as stagnation periods. Extensive stagnation periods occurred in the 1920s/1930s, in the 1950s/1960s and in the 1980s/beginning of 1990s Lehmann et al., 2022). Bottom salinity variations in the Arkona Basin represent water exchange between the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak-Kattegat area. The increasing salinity signal in that area does not indicate that a Major Baltic Inflow has occurred. The mean sea level of the Baltic Sea derived from satellite altimetry data can be used as a proxy for the detection of saline water inflows to the Baltic Sea from the North Sea (Raudsepp et al., 2018). The medium and strong inflow events increase oxygen concentration in the near-bottom layer of the Bornholm Basin while some medium size inflows have no impact on deep water salinity (Mohrholz, 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nTime series of the bottom salinity variations in the Arkona basin allow a monitoring of the sporadic nature of the water inflow/outflow events. Bottom salinity in the Arkona basin varies in the range of 11 to 25 g/kg. The maximum bottom salinity value corresponds to the Major Baltic Inflow in 2014. The other peak salinity values correspond to the Major Baltic Inflows in 1993 and 2002. Episodes of low salinity in the Arkona Basin indicate the time instances of barotropic outflows of brackish water from the Baltic Sea. The bottom salinity signal in the Bornholm basin shows three Major Baltic Inflow events, i.e. the first in 1993, then in 2002 and the last one in 2014. The bottom salinity of the Bornholm basin increased to 20 g/kg as a consequence of the last Major Baltic Inflow. Since then, the salinity in the Bornholm basin has decreased from 20 to the level of 16 g/kg in eight years. There was no Major Baltic Inflow in winter 2022/23.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of bottom salinity in the Arkona and Bornholm Basins for the period of 1993-2022, derived from regional Copernicus Marine Service reanalysis  (BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011) (a).

The system assimilates significant wave height (SWH) altimeter data and wave spectral data (Envisat and CFOSAT), supplied by MF. Both, the MY and the NRT products, are fed by ECMWF hourly winds. Specifically, the MY system is forced by the ERA5 reanalysis wind data. As boundary conditions, the NRT system uses the 2D wave spectra from the Copernicus Marine GLOBAL forecast system, whereas the MY system is nested to the GLOBAL reanalysis.\nThe product offers hourly instantaneous fields of different wave parameters, including Wave Height, Period and Direction for total spectrum; fields of Wind Wave (or wind sea), Primary Swell Wave and Secondary Swell for partitioned wave spectra; and the highest wave variables, such as maximum crest height and maximum crest-to-trough height. Additionally, climatological parameters of significant wave height (VHM0) and zero -crossing wave period (VTM02) are delivered for the time interval 1993-2016.\n\n**Product Citation**: \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing [products.](http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169)\n\n**DOI (Product)**: \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00030", "providers": [{"name": "NOLOGIN", "roles": ["producer"]}, {"name": "Copernicus Marine Service", "roles": ["host", "processor"], "url": "https://marine.copernicus.eu"}], "doi": "10.48670/moi-00030"}, "IBI_OMI_CURRENTS_cui": {"instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,iberian-biscay-irish-seas,ibi-omi-currents-cui,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": "proprietary", "title": "Iberia Biscay Ireland Coastal Upwelling Index from Reanalysis", "missionStartDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "**DEFINITION**\n\nThe Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI) is computed along the African and the Iberian Peninsula coasts.

Such deflection is produced by Ekman transport induced by persistent winds parallel to the coastline (Sverdrup, 1938). When this transported water is forced, the mass balance is maintained by pumping of ascending intermediate water. This water is typically denser, cooler and richer in nutrients. The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland domain contains two well-documented Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems, they are hosted under the same system known as Canary Current Upwelling System (Fraga, 1981; Hempel, 1982). This system is one of the major coastal upwelling regions of the world and it is produced by the eastern closure of the Subtropical Gyre. The North West African (NWA) coast presents an intense upwelling region that extends from Morocco to south of Senegal, likewise the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) shows a seasonal upwelling behavior. These two upwelling domains are separated by the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz, where the coastline does not allow the formation of upwelling conditions from 34\u00baN up to 37\u00baN.\nThe Copernicus Marine Service Coastal Upwelling Index is defined following the steps of several previous upwelling indices described in literature. More details and full scientific evaluation can be found in the dedicated section in the first issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State report (Sotillo et al., 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe NWA coast (latitudes below 34\u00baN) shows  a quite constantlow variability of the periodicity and the intensity of the upwelling, few periods of upwelling intensifications are found in years 1993-1995, and 2003-2004.\nIn the IP coast (latitudes higher than 37\u00baN) the interannual variability is more remarkable showing years with high upwelling activity (1994, 2004, and 2015-2017) followed by periods of lower activity (1996-1998, 2003, 2011, and 2013).\nAccording to the results of the IBI-NRT system, 2020 was a year with weak upwelling in the IP latitudes. \nWhile in the NWA coast the upwelling activity was more intense than the average.\nThe analysis of trends in the period 1993-2019 shows significant positive trend of the upwelling index in the IP latitudes. This trend implies an increase of temperature differences between the coastal and offshore waters of approximately 0.02 \u00b0C/Year.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00248\n\n**References:**\n\n* Fraga F. 1981.

Sea ice concentration is the fractional coverage of an ocean area covered with sea ice. The Baltic Sea area having more than 15% of sea ice concentration is included into the sea ice volume analysis. Daily sea ice volume values are computed from the daily sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness maps. The data used to produce the charts are Synthetic Aperture Radar images as well as in situ observations from ice breakers (Uiboupin et al., 2010; https://www.smhi.se/data/oceanografi/havsis). The annual course of the sea ice volume has been calculated as daily mean ice volume for each day-of-year over the period October 1992 \u2013 September 2014. Weekly smoothed time series of the sea ice volume have been calculated from daily values using a 7-day moving average filter.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice coverage has a vital role in the annual course of physical and ecological conditions in the Baltic Sea. Knowledge of the sea ice volume facilitates planning of icebreaking activity and operation of the icebreakers (Valdez Banda et al., 2015; Bostr\u00f6m and \u00d6sterman, 2017). A long-term monitoring of ice parameters is required for design and installation of offshore constructions in seasonally ice covered seas (Heinonen and Rissanen, 2017). A reduction of the sea ice volume in the Baltic Sea has a critical impact on the population of ringed seals (Harkonen et al., 2008). Ringed seals need stable ice conditions for about two months for breeding and moulting (Sundqvist et al., 2012). The sea ice is a habitat for diverse biological assemblages (Enberg et al., 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the Baltic Sea, ice season may start in October and may last until June. Maximum sea ice volume is observed in March on average. The ice season 2021/22 had low maximum sea ice volume in the Baltic Sea reaching about 17 km3. During the preceding period 1993-2020, the yearly maximum ice volume varied from 4 km3 in 2020 to 60 km3 in 1996. There is a statistically significant decreasing trend of -0.74 km3/year (p=0.02) in the maximum sea ice volume of the Baltic Sea.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\n(a) Time series of day-of-year average sea ice volume derived from remote sensing and in situ observations (http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/oceanografi/havsis, Uiboupin et al., 2010).

Horizontal averaging has been done over the Baltic Sea domain (13 \u00b0E - 31 \u00b0E and 53 \u00b0N - 66 \u00b0N; excluding the Skagerrak strait). The temperature trend has been obtained through a linear fit for each time series of horizontally averaged annual temperature and at each depth level.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea in North-Eastern Europe. The temperature of the upper mixed layer of the Baltic Sea is characterised by a strong seasonal cycle driven by the annual course of solar radiation (Lepp\u00e4ranta and Myrberg, 2008). The maximum water temperatures in the upper layer are reached in July and August and the minimum during February, when the Baltic Sea becomes partially frozen (CMEMS OMI Baltic Sea Sea Ice Extent: BALTIC_OMI_SI_extent, CMEMS OMI Baltic Sea Sea Ice Volume: BALTIC_OMI_SI_volume). Seasonal thermocline, developing in the depth range of 10-30 m in spring, reaches its maximum strength in summer and is eroded in autumn. During autumn and winter the Baltic Sea is thermally mixed down to the permanent halocline in the depth range of 60-80 metres (Matth\u00e4us, 1984). The 20\u201350 m thick cold intermediate layer forms below the upper mixed layer in March and is observed until October within the 15-65 m depth range (Chubarenko and Stepanova, 2018; Liblik and Lips, 2011). The deep layers of the Baltic Sea are disconnected from the ventilated upper ocean layers, and temperature variations are predominantly driven by mixing processes and horizontal advection. A warming trend of the sea surface waters is positively correlated with the increasing trend of diffuse attenuation of light (Kd490) and satellite-detected chlorophyll concentration (Kahru et al., 2016). Temperature increase in the water column could accelerate oxygen consumption during organic matter oxidation (Savchuk, 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe subsurface temperature over the 1993-2022 period shows warming trends of about 0.05 \u00b0C/year at all depths. The largest warming trend of 0.07 \u00b0C/year is recorded in the deep layer starting at the depth of 100 m. In the upper mixed layer, temperature has increased with the rate of 0.05 oC/year. In the cold intermediate layer, temperature increase has been lowest, i.e 0.03 oC/year. A positive trend in the sea surface waters has been detected since the 1990s (BACCII Author Team, 2015) as well as a decreasing trend of the start day of the spring phytoplankton bloom (Raudsepp et al., 2019; Kahru et al., 2016). From the measurements Savchuk (2018) has calculated the temperature trend of 0.04 oC/year on average in the deep layers (>60m) of the Baltic Proper since 1979. The temperature trend in the upper layer of 60-m has the widest confidence interval, which indicates the largest interannual variability in that layer.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nThe vertical profile of subsurface horizontally averaged temperature trend for the period of 1993-2022.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The North-West Shelf Multi Year Product (NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009) and the Analysis product (NORTHWESTSHELF_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_004_013).\nTwo parameters are included on this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThis domain comprises the North West European continental shelf where depths do not exceed 200m and deeper Atlantic waters to the North and West. For these deeper waters, the North-South temperature gradient dominates (Liu and Tanhua, 2021). Temperature over the continental shelf is affected also by the various local currents in this region and by the shallow depth of the water (Elliott et al., 1990). Atmospheric heat waves can warm the whole water column, especially in the southern North Sea, much of which is no more than 30m deep (Holt et al., 2012). Warm summertime water observed in the Norwegian trench is outflow heading North from the Baltic Sea and from the North Sea itself.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe 99th percentile SST product can be considered to represent approximately the warmest 4 days for the sea surface in Summer. Maximum anomalies for 2020 are up to 4oC warmer than the 1993-2019 average in the western approaches, Celtic and Irish Seas, English Channel and the southern North Sea. For the atmosphere, Summer 2020 was exceptionally warm and sunny in southern UK (Kendon et al., 2021), with heatwaves in June and August. Further north in the UK, the atmosphere was closer to long-term average temperatures. Overall, the 99th percentile SST anomalies show a similar pattern, with the exceptional warm anomalies in the south of the domain.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product)**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00273\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

These Major Baltic Inflows occur seldom, sometimes many years apart (Mohrholz, 2018). The Major Baltic Inflow OMI consists of the time series of the bottom layer salinity in the Arkona Basin and in the Bornholm Basin (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm) and the time-depth plot of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the Gotland Basin. Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen profiles in the Gotland Basin enable us to estimate the amount of the Major Baltic Inflow water that has reached central Baltic, the depth interval of which has been the most affected, and how much the oxygen conditions have been improved.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a huge brackish water basin in Northern Europe whose salinity is controlled by its freshwater budget and by the water exchange with the North Sea (e.g. Neumann et al., 2017). This implies that fresher water lies on top of water with higher salinity. The saline water inflows to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits, especially the Major Baltic Inflows, shape hydrophysical conditions in the Gotland Basin of the central Baltic Sea, which in turn have a substantial influence on marine ecology on different trophic levels (Bergen et al., 2018; Raudsepp et al.,2019). In the absence of the Major Baltic Inflows, oxygen in the deeper layers of the Gotland Basin is depleted and replaced by hydrogen sulphide (e.g., Savchuk, 2018). As the Baltic Sea is connected to the North Sea only through very narrow and shallow channels in the Danish Straits, inflows of high salinity and oxygenated water into the Baltic occur only intermittently (e.g., Mohrholz, 2018). Long-lasting periods of oxygen depletion in the deep layers of the central Baltic Sea accompanied by a salinity decline and overall weakening of the vertical stratification are referred to as stagnation periods. Extensive stagnation periods occurred in the 1920s/1930s, in the 1950s/1960s and in the 1980s/beginning of 1990s (Lehmann et al., 20225).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nMajor Baltic Inflows in 1993, 2002 and 2014 (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm) show a very clear signal in the Gotland Basin, where Major Baltic Inflow events affect the water salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions up to 100-m depth. Each of the Major Baltic Inflows results in the increase of deep layer salinity in the Gotland Basin right after the event occurs, but maximum bottom salinities are detected about 1.5 years later. The periods with elevated salinity are rather long-lasting after the Major Baltic Inflows (about three years). Since 2017, the salinity below 150 m depth has decreased, but the halocline has pushed upwards, which indicates saline water transport to the intermediate layers of the Gotland Basin. Usually, temperature drops right after the Major Baltic Inflow occurs, which indicates that cold water from adjacent upstream areas submerges to the bottom in the Gotland Deep. During the period of 1993-1997, deep water temperature stayed relatively low (less than 6 \u00b0C). Starting from 1998, the deep water has become warmer. Even moderate inflows, like in 1997/98, 2006/07 and 2018/19 brought warmer water to the bottom layer of the Gotland Basin. Since 2019, warm water (more than 7 \u00b0C) has occupied the layer below 100-m depth. Compared to the year 1993, the water temperature below the halocline has increased about 2 \u00b0C. Also, the temperature of the cold intermediate layer has increased over the period 1993-2022. Oxygen concentrations start to decline quite rapidly after the temporary oxygenation of the bottom waters. In 2014, the reasons were the lack of smaller inflows after the Major Baltic Inflow that could supply more oxygenated water to the Gotland Basin (Neumann et al., 2017) and intensification of biological oxygen consumption (Savchuk, 2018; Meier et al., 2018). In addition, warm water has facilitated oxygen consumption in the deep layer and an enhancement of anoxia. In 2022, oxygen was completely consumed below the depth of 75 metres.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nProfiles of salinity (a), temperature (b) and dissolved oxygen concentration (c) for the period of 1993-2022 in the Gotland Basin from the Copernicus Marine Service Baltic Sea in situ multiyear and near real time observations (INSITU_BAL_PHYBGCWAV_DISCRETE_MYNRT_013_032).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00210\n\n**References:**\n\n* Lehmann, A., Myrberg, K., Post, P., Chubarenko, I., Dailidiene, I., Hinrichsen, H.-H., H\u00fcssy, K., Liblik, T., Meier, H.

It contains a Reanalysis dataset, an Interim dataset covering the period after the reanalysis until 1 month before present and a monthly climatological dataset (reference period 1993-2016). The Reanalysis dataset is a multi-year wave reanalysis starting from January 1993, composed by hourly wave parameters at 1/24\u00b0 horizontal resolution, covering the Mediterranean Sea and extending up to 18.125W into the Atlantic Ocean. The Med-WAV modelling system is based on wave model WAM 4.6.2 and has been developed as a nested sequence of two computational grids (coarse and fine) to ensure that swell propagating from the North Atlantic (NA) towards the strait of Gibraltar is correctly entering the Mediterranean Sea. The coarse grid covers the North Atlantic Ocean from 75\u00b0W to 10\u00b0E and from 70\u00b0 N to 10\u00b0 S in 1/6\u00b0 resolution while the nested fine grid covers the Mediterranean Sea from 18.125\u00b0 W to 36.2917\u00b0 E and from 30.1875\u00b0 N to 45.9792\u00b0 N with a 1/24\u00b0 resolution. The modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins.  The wave system also includes an optimal interpolation assimilation scheme assimilating significant wave height along track satellite observations available through CMEMS and it is forced with daily averaged currents from Med-Physics and with 1-h, 0.25\u00b0 horizontal-resolution ERA5 reanalysis 10m-above-sea-surface winds from ECMWF.\n\n**Product Citation**: \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169\n\n**DOI (product)**: \nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/cmcc/medsea_multiyear_wav_006_012\n\n**DOI (Interim dataset)**:\nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/ CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012_MEDWAM3I\n\n**References:**\n\n* Korres, G., Ravdas, M., Denaxa, D., & Sotiropoulou, M.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_007_004) and the Analysis product (BLKSEA_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHYS_007_001).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the Essential Ocean Variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. Particularly in the Black Sea, ocean-atmospheric processes together with its general cyclonic circulation (Rim Current) play an important role on the sea surface temperature variability (Capet et al. 2012). As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. The 99th mean percentile of sea surface temperature provides a worth information about the variability of the sea surface temperature and warming trends but has not been investigated with details in the Black Sea.\nWhile the global-averaged sea surface temperatures have increased since the beginning of the 20th century (Hartmann et al., 2013). Recent studies indicated a warming trend of the sea surface temperature in the Black Sea in the latest years (Mulet et al., 2018; Sakali and Ba\u015fusta, 2018). A specific analysis on the interannual variability of the basin-averaged sea surface temperature revealed a higher positive trend in its eastern region (Ginzburg et al., 2004). For the past three decades, Sakali and Ba\u015fusta (2018) presented an increase in sea surface temperature that varied along both east\u2013west and south\u2013north directions in the Black Sea. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean annual 99th percentile in the period 1993\u20132019 exhibits values ranging from 25.50 to 26.50 oC in the western and central regions of the Black Sea. The values increase towards the east, exceeding 27.5 oC. This contrasting west-east pattern may be linked to the basin wide cyclonic circulation. There are regions showing lower values, below 25.75 oC, such as a small area west of Crimean Peninsula in the vicinity of the Sevastopol anticyclone, the Northern Ukraine region, in particular close to the Odessa and the Karkinytska Gulf due to the freshwaters from the land and a narrow area along the Turkish coastline in the south. Results for 2020 show negative anomalies in the area of influence of the Bosporus and the Bulgarian offshore region up to the Crimean peninsula, while the North West shelf exhibits a positive anomaly as in the Eastern basin. The highest positive value is occurring in the Eastern Tukish coastline nearest the Batumi gyre area. This may be related to the variously increase of sea surface temperature in such a way the southern regions have experienced a higher warming.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00216\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

There are uncertainties in the deep profile associated with how much transport is returned in the upper (1-3km) or lower (3-5km) North Atlantic deep waters (Roberts et al 2013, Sinha et al 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS** \n\nThe AMOC strength at 1000m is found to be 17.1 \u00b1 4.7 Sv (1 Sverdrup=106m3/s; range is 2 x standard deviation of multi-product). See also Jackson et al (2018).\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00231\n\n**References:**\n\n* Jackson, L., C.

The maximum value in depth is then taken as the strength in Sverdrups (Sv=1x106m3/s). The observations come from the RAPID array (Smeed et al, 2017).    \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports heat northwards in the Atlantic and plays a key role in regional and global climate (Srokosz et al, 2012). There is a northwards transport in the upper kilometer resulting from northwards flow in the Gulf Stream and wind-driven Ekman transport, and southwards flow in the ocean interior and in deep western boundary currents (Srokosz et al, 2012). The observations have revealed variability at monthly to decadal timescales including a temporary weakening in 2009/10 (McCarthy et al, 2012) and a decrease from 2005-2012 (Smeed et al, 2014; Smeed et al, 2018). Other studies have suggested that this weakening may be a result of variability (Smeed et al, 2014; Jackson et al 2017).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS **\n\nThe AMOC strength exhibits significant variability on many timescales with a temporary weakening in 2009/10. There has been a weakening from 2005-2012 (-0.67 Sv/year, (p=0.03) in the observations and -0.53 Sv/year (p=0.04) in the multi-product mean). The multi-product suggests an earlier increase from 2001-2006 (0.48 Sv/yr, p=0.04), and a weakening in 1998-99, however before this period there is significant uncertainty. This indicates that the changes observed are likely to be variability rather than an ongoing trend (see also Jackson et al, 2018).\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00232\n\n**References:**\n\n* Jackson, L.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_007_006) and the Analysis product (BLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_007_003).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multy Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1979-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2020.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, including biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2015, IPCC, 2019). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions (IPCC, 2021).\nSignificant Wave Height mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea region shows west-eastern  dependence demonstrating that the highest values of the average annual 99th percentiles are in the areas where high winds and long fetch are simultaneously present. The largest values of the mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea in the southewestern Black Sea are around 3.5 m, while in the eastern part of the basin are around 2.5 m (Staneva et al., 2019a and 2019b).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSignificant Wave Height mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea region shows west-eastern  dependence with largest values in the southwestern Black Sea, with values as high as 3.5 m, while the 99th percentile values in the eastern part of the basin are around 2.5 m.  The Black Sea, the 99th mean percentile for 2002-2019 shows a similar pattern demonstrating that the highest values of the mean annual 99th percentile are in the western Black Sea. This pattern is consistent with the previous studies, e.g. of (Akp\u0131nar and K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc, 2012; and Akpinar et al., 2016).\nThe anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020 is mostly negative with values down to ~-45 cm. The highest negative anomalies for 2020 are observed in the southeastern area where the multi-year mean 99th percentile is the lowest. The highest positive anomalies of the 99th percentile in 2020 are located in the southwestern Black Sea and along the eastern coast. The map of anomalies for 2020, presenting alternate bands of positive and negative values depending on latitude, is consistent with the yearly west-east displacement of the tracks of the largest storms. \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00214\n\n**References:**\n\n* Akp\u0131nar, A.; K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc, M.\u02d9I.

Variations in OHC can induce changes in ocean stratification, currents, sea ice and ice shelfs (IPCC, 2019; 2021); they set time scales and dominate Earth system adjustments to climate variability and change (Hansen et al., 2011); they are a key player in ocean-atmosphere interactions and sea level change (WCRP, 2018) and they can impact marine ecosystems and human livelihoods (IPCC, 2019).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nRegional trends for the period 2005-2019 from the Copernicus Marine Service multi-ensemble approach show warming at rates ranging from the global mean average up to more than 8 W/m2 in some specific regions (e.g. northern hemisphere western boundary current regimes).

Daily regional mean values are calculated by performing the average (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. A fixed annual cycle is extracted from the original signal, using the Census-I method as described in Vantrepotte et al. (2009). The deasonalised time series is derived by subtracting the seasonal cycle from the original time series, and then fitted to a linear regression to, finally, obtain the linear trend. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton \u2013 and chlorophyll concentration , which is  a measure of  phytoplankton concentration \u2013 respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions. Chlorophyll concentration is highly seasonal in the Arctic Ocean region due to a strong dependency on light and nutrient availability, which in turn are driven by seasonal sunlight and sea-ice cover dynamics, as well as changes in mixed layer. In the past two decades, an increase in annual net primary production by Arctic Ocean phytoplankton has been observed and linked to sea-ice decline (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015); in the same line Kahru et al. (2011) have showed that chlorophyll concentration peaks are appearing increasingly earlier in the year in parts of the Arctic. It is therefore of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales in the area, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWhile the overall trend average for the 1997-2021 period in the Arctic Sea is positive (0.86 \u00b1 0.17 % per year), a continued plateau in the linear trend, initiated in 2013 is observed in the time series extension, with both the amplitude and the baseline of the cycle continuing to decrease during 2021 as reported for previous years (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). In particular, the annual average for the region in 2021 is 1.05 mg m-3 - a 30% reduction on 2020 values. There appears to be no appreciable changes in the timings or amplitude of the 2021 spring and autumn blooms. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00188\n\n**References:**\n\n* Arrigo, K.

Thus, positive/negative values indicate the percentage of hourly data that exceed the threshold above/below the climatic average, respectively.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOcean waves have a high relevance over the coastal ecosystems and human activities. Extreme wave events can entail severe impacts over human infrastructures and coastal dynamics. However, the incidence of severe (90th percentile) wave events also have valuable relevance affecting the development of human activities and coastal environments. The Strong Wave Incidence index based on the CMEMS regional analysis and reanalysis product provides information on the frequency of severe wave events.\nThe IBI-MFC covers the Europe\u2019s Atlantic coast in a region bounded by the 26\u00baN and 56\u00baN parallels, and the 19\u00baW and 5\u00baE meridians. The western European coast is located at the end of the long fetch of the subpolar North Atlantic (M\u00f8rk et al., 2010), one of the world\u2019s greatest wave generating regions (Folley, 2017). Several studies have analyzed changes of the ocean wave variability in the North Atlantic Ocean (Bacon and Carter, 1991; Kursnir et al., 1997; WASA Group, 1998; Bauer, 2001; Wang and Swail, 2004; Dupuis et al., 2006; Wolf and Woolf, 2006; Dodet et al., 2010; Young et al., 2011; Young and Ribal, 2019). The observed variability is composed of fluctuations ranging from the weather scale to the seasonal scale, together with long-term fluctuations on interannual to decadal scales associated with large-scale climate oscillations. Since the ocean surface state is mainly driven by wind stresses, part of this variability in Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region is connected to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (Bacon and Carter, 1991; Hurrell, 1995;  Bouws et al., 1996, Bauer, 2001; Woolf et al., 2002; Tsimplis et al., 2005; Gleeson et al., 2017). However, later studies have quantified the relationships between the wave climate and other atmospheric climate modes such as the East Atlantic pattern, the Arctic Oscillation pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian pattern and the Scandinavian pattern (Izaguirre et al., 2011, Mat\u00ednez-Asensio et al., 2016).\nThe Strong Wave Incidence index provides information on incidence of stormy events in four monitoring regions in the IBI domain. The selected monitoring regions (Figure 1.A) are aimed to provide a summarized view of the diverse climatic conditions in the IBI regional domain: Wav1 region monitors the influence of stormy conditions in the West coast of Iberian Peninsula, Wav2 region is devoted to monitor the variability of stormy conditions in the Bay of Biscay, Wav3 region is focused in the northern half of IBI domain, this region is strongly affected by the storms transported by the subpolar front, and Wav4 is focused in the influence of marine storms in the North-East African Coast, the Gulf of Cadiz and Canary Islands.\nMore details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Pascual et al., 2020).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe analysis of the index in the last decades do not show significant trends of the strong wave conditions over the period 1992-2021 with 99% confidence. The maximum wave event reported in region WAV1 (B) occurred in February 2014, producing an increment of 34% of strong wave conditions in the region. Two maximum wave events are found in WAV2 (C) with an increment of 28% of high wave conditions in November 2009 and February 2014. As in regions WAV1 and WAV2, in the region WAV3 (D), a strong wave event took place in February 2014, this event is the one of the maximum events reported in the region with an increment of strong wave conditions of 20%, two months before (December 2013) there was a storm of similar characteristics affecting this region. The region WAV4 (E) present its maximum wave event in January 1996, such event produced a 33% of increment of strong wave conditions in the region. Despite of each monitoring region is affected by independent wave events; the analysis shows several past higher-than-average wave events that were propagated though several monitoring regions: November-December 2010 (WAV3 and WAV2); February 2014 (WAV1, WAV2, and WAV3); and February-March 2018 (WAV1 and WAV4). \nThe analysis of the NRT period (January 2022 onwards) depicts a significant event that occurred in November 2022, which affected the WAV2 and WAV3 regions (resulting in a 25% and 19% increase in maximum wave conditions in the WAV2 and WAV3 regions, respectively). Additionally, a second event in June 2022 impacted the WAV1 and WAV3 regions, leading to a 21% and 17% increase in maximum wave heights, respectively. While these mentioned events are noteworthy, both cases exhibit an intensity in line with the climatic variability characteristic of each region.\nThe NRT analysis period for the WAV4 region does not indicate any notable events. However, the event described for the WAV2 and WAV3 regions in June 2022 had a moderate impact on this region, resulting in a 13% increase in maximum wave height.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\n(A) Mean 90th percentile of Sea Wave Height computed from IBI_REANALYSIS_WAV_005_006 product at an hourly basis.

The regional thermosteric sea level values are then averaged from 60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N aiming to monitor interannual to long term global sea level variations caused by temperature driven ocean volume changes through thermal expansion as expressed in meters (m).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nMost of the interannual variability and trends in regional sea level is caused by changes in steric sea level. At mid and low latitudes, the steric sea level signal is essentially due to temperature changes, i.e. the thermosteric effect (Stammer et al., 2013, Meyssignac et al., 2016). Salinity changes play only a local role. Regional trends of thermosteric sea level can be significantly larger compared to their globally averaged versions (Storto et al., 2018). Except for shallow shelf sea and high latitudes (> 60\u00b0 latitude), regional thermosteric sea level variations are mostly related to ocean circulation changes, in particular in the tropics where the sea level variations and trends are the most intense over the last two decades. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSignificant (i.e. when the signal exceeds the noise) regional trends for the period 2005-2019 from the Copernicus Marine Service multi-ensemble approach show a thermosteric sea level rise at rates ranging from the global mean average up to more than 8 mm/year. There are specific regions where a negative trend is observed above noise at rates up to about -8 mm/year such as in the subpolar North Atlantic, or the western tropical Pacific. These areas are characterized by strong year-to-year variability (Dubois et al., 2018; Capotondi et al., 2020). \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00241\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capotondi, A., Wittenberg, A.T., Kug, J.-S., Takahashi, K. and McPhaden, M.J.

Daily regional mean values are calculated by performing the average (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. A fixed annual cycle is extracted from the original signal, using the Census-I method as described in Vantrepotte et al. (2009). The deseasonalised time series is derived by subtracting the mean seasonal cycle from the original time series, and then fitted to a linear regression to, finally, obtain the linear trend. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton \u2013 and chlorophyll concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton \u2013 respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature, light and nutrients availability, and mixing. The response in the North Atlantic ranges from cyclical to decadal oscillations (Henson et al., 2009); it is therefore of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the North Atlantic are known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with the initiation of the spring bloom showing a nominal correlation with sea surface temperature and the NAO index (Zhai et al., 2013).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWhile the overall trend average for the 1997-2021 period in the North Atlantic Ocean is slightly positive (0.16 \u00b1 0.12 % per year), an underlying low frequency harmonic signal can be seen in the deseasonalised data. The annual average for the region in 2021 is 0.25 mg m-3. Though no appreciable changes in the timing of the spring and autumn blooms have been observed during 2021, a lower peak chlorophyll concentration is observed in the timeseries extension. This decrease in peak concentration with respect to the previous year is contributing to the reduction trend.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00194\n\n**References:**\n\n* Henson, S.

The salinity data are extracted from several CMEMS products and averaged in the corresponding monitoring domain: \n* IBI-MYP: IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002\n* IBI-NRT: IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHYS_005_001\n* GLO-MYP: GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_030\n* CORA: INSITU_GLO_TS_REP_OBSERVATIONS_013_002_b\n* ARMOR: MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012\n\nThe anomalies of salinity have been computed relative to the monthly climatology obtained from IBI-MYP. Outcomes from diverse products are combined to deliver a unique multi-product result. Multi-year products (IBI-MYP, GLO,MYP, CORA, and ARMOR) are used to show an ensemble mean and the standard deviation of members in the covered period. The IBI-NRT short-range product is not included in the ensemble, but used to provide the deterministic analysis of salinity anomalies in the most recent year.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Mediterranean Outflow Water is a saline and warm water mass generated from the mixing processes of the North Atlantic Central Water and the Mediterranean waters overflowing the Gibraltar sill (Daniault et al., 1994). The resulting water mass is accumulated in an area west of the Iberian Peninsula (Daniault et al., 1994) and spreads into the North Atlantic following advective pathways (Holliday et al. 2003; Lozier and Stewart 2008, de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019).\nThe importance of the heat and salt transport promoted by the Mediterranean Outflow Water flow has implications beyond the boundaries of the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland domain (Reid 1979, Paillet et al. 1998, van Aken 2000). For example, (i) it contributes substantially to the salinity of the Norwegian Current (Reid 1979), (ii) the mixing processes with the Labrador Sea Water promotes a salt transport into the inner North Atlantic (Talley and MacCartney, 1982; van Aken, 2000), and (iii) the deep anti-cyclonic Meddies developed in the African slope is a cause of the large-scale westward penetration of Mediterranean salt (Iorga and Lozier, 1999).\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the core of Mediterranean Outflow Water is affected by inter-annual variability. This variability is mainly caused by a shift of the MOW dominant northward-westward pathways (Bozec et al. 2011), it is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (Bozec et al. 2011) and leads to the displacement of the boundaries of the water core (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019). The variability of the advective pathways of MOW is an oceanographic process that conditions the destination of the Mediterranean salt transport in the North Atlantic. Therefore, monitoring the Mediterranean Outflow Water variability becomes decisive to have a proper understanding of the climate system and its evolution (e.g. Bozec et al. 2011, Pascual-Collar et al. 2019).\nThe CMEMS IBI-OMI_WMHE_mow product is aimed to monitor the inter-annual variability of the Mediterranean Outflow Water in the North Atlantic. The objective is the establishment of a long-term monitoring program to observe the variability and trends of the Mediterranean water mass in the IBI regional seas. To do that, the salinity anomaly is monitored in key areas selected to represent the main reservoir and the three main advective spreading pathways. More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report Pascual et al., 2018 and de Pascual-Collar et al. 2019.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe absence of long-term trends in the monitoring domain Reservoir (b) suggests the steadiness of water mass properties involved on the formation of Mediterranean Outflow Water.\nResults obtained in monitoring box North (c) present an alternance of periods with positive and negative anomalies. The last negative period started in 2016 reaching up to the present. Such negative events are linked to the decrease of the northward pathway of Mediterranean Outflow Water (Bozec et al., 2011), which appears to return to steady conditions in 2020 and 2021. \nResults for box West (d) reveal a cycle of negative (2015-2017) and positive (2017 up to the present) anomalies. The positive anomalies of salinity in this region are correlated with an increase of the westward transport of salinity into the inner North Atlantic (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019), which appear to be maintained for years 2020-2021.\nResults in monitoring boxes North and West are consistent with independent studies (Bozec et al., 2011; and de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019), suggesting a westward displacement of Mediterranean Outflow Water and the consequent contraction of the northern boundary.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00258\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bozec A, Lozier MS, Chassignet EP, Halliwell GR. 2011.

Net volume transport of Overflow Waters (\u03c3\u03b8 >27.8 kg/m3) exiting from the Nordic Seas to the North Atlantic via the Denmark Strait and Faroe Shetland Channel. For further details, see Ch. 3.2 in von Schuckmann et al. (2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe poleward flow of relatively warm and saline Atlantic Water through the Nordic Seas to the Arctic Basin, balanced by the overflow waters exiting the Nordic Seas, governs the exchanges between the North Atlantic and the Arctic as well as the distribution of oceanic heat within the Arctic (e.g., Mauritzen et al., 2011; Rudels, 2012). Atlantic Water transported poleward has been found to significantly influence the sea-ice cover in the Barents Sea (Sand\u00f8 et al., 2010; \u00c5rthun et al., 2012; Onarheim et al., 2015) and near Svalbard (Piechura and Walczowski, 2009). Furthermore, Atlantic Water flow through the eastern Nordic seas and its associated heat loss and densification are important factors for the formation of overflow waters in the region (Mauritzen, 1996; Eldevik et al., 2009). These overflow waters together with those generated in the Arctic, exit the Greenland Scotland Ridge, which further contribute to the North Atlantic Deep Water (Dickson and Brown, 1994) and thus play an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Eldevik et al., 2009; Ch. 2.3 in von Schuckmann et al., 2016). In addition to the transport of heat, the Atlantic Water also transports nutrients and zooplankton (e.g., Sundby, 2000), and it carries large amounts of ichthyoplankton of commercially important species, such as Arcto-Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua) and Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) along the Norwegian coast. The Atlantic Water flow thus plays an integral part in defining both the physical and biological border between the boreal and Arctic realm. Variability of Atlantic Water flow to the Barents Sea has been found to move the position of the ice edge (Onarheim et al., 2015) as well as habitats of various species in the Barents Sea ecosystem (Fossheim et al., 2015).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe flow of Atlantic Water through the F\u00e6r\u00f8y-Shetland Channel amounts to 2.7 Sv (Berx et al., 2013). The corresponding model-based estimate was 2.5 Sv for the period 1993-2021. \nIn the Barents Sea Opening, the model indicates a long-term average net Atlantic Water inflow of 2.2 Sv, as compared with the long-term estimate from observations of 1.8 Sv (Smedsrud et al., 2013).\nIn the Fram Strait, the model data indicates a positive trend in the Atlantic Water transport to the Arctic. This trend may be explained by increased temperature in the West Spitsbergen Current during the period 2005-2010 (e.g., Walczowski et al., 2012), which caused a larger fraction of the water mass to be characterized as Atlantic Water (T > 2 \u00b0C).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00189\n\n**References:**\n\n* Berx B.

The values are given in Sverdrup (Sv).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe ocean transports heat and mass by vertical overturning and horizontal circulation, and is one of the fundamental dynamic components of the Earth\u2019s energy budget (IPCC, 2013). There are spatial asymmetries in the energy budget resulting from the Earth\u2019s orientation to the sun and the meridional variation in absorbed radiation which support a transfer of energy from the tropics towards the poles. However, there are spatial variations in the loss of heat by the ocean through sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as differences in ocean basin geometry and current systems. These complexities support a pattern of oceanic heat transport that is not strictly from lower to high latitudes. Moreover, it is not stationary and we are only beginning to unravel its variability. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean transports estimated by the ensemble global reanalysis are comparable to estimates based on observations; the uncertainties on these integrated quantities are still large in all the available products. At Drake Passage, the multi-product approach (product no. 2.4.1) is larger than the value (130 Sv) of Lumpkin and Speer (2007), but smaller than the new observational based results of Colin de Verdi\u00e8re and Ollitrault, (2016) (175 Sv) and Donohue (2017) (173.3 Sv).\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00247\n\n**References:**\n\n* Lumpkin R, Speer K. 2007.

Additionally, OHC is one of the six Global Climate Indicators recommended by the World Meterological Organisation (WMO, 2017). \nIn the last decades, the upper North Atlantic Ocean experienced a reversal of climatic trends for temperature and salinity. While the period 1990-2004 is characterized by decadal-scale ocean warming, the period 2005-2014 shows a substantial cooling and freshening. Such variations are discussed to be linked to ocean internal dynamics, and air-sea interactions (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2019; Robson et al 2016). Together with changes linked to the connectivity between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea (Masina et al., 2022), these variations affect the temporal evolution of regional ocean heat content in the IBI region.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe ensemble mean OHC anomaly time series over the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region are dominated by strong year-to-year variations, and an ocean warming trend of 0.49\u00b10.4 W/m2 is barely significant.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00316\n\n**References:**\n\n* Collins M., M.

This OMI is derived from the CMEMS Reprocessed Black Sea L4 SST satellite product (SST_BS_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_022, see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-BLKSEA-SST.pdf), which provided the SSTs used to compute the SST trend over the Black Sea. This reprocessed product consists of daily (nighttime) optimally interpolated 0.05\u00b0 grid resolution SST maps over the Black Sea built from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Merchant et al., 2019) and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) initiatives, including also an adjusted version of the AVHRR Pathfinder dataset version 5.3 (Saha et al., 2018) to increase the input observation coverage. Trend analysis has been performed by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (see e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005), which has the effect of filtering the input SST time series acting as a low bandpass filter for interannual variations. Mann-Kendall test and Sens\u2019s method (Sen 1968) were applied to assess whether there was a monotonic upward or downward trend and to estimate the slope of the trend and its 95% confidence interval.

SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). In the last decades, since the availability of satellite data (beginning of 1980s), the Black Sea has experienced a warming trend in SST (see e.g. Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2010; Mulet et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe spatial pattern of the Black Sea SST trend reveals a general warming tendency, ranging from 0.053 \u00b0C/year to 0.080 \u00b0C/year. The spatial pattern of SST trend is rather homogeneous over the whole basin. Highest values characterize the eastern basin, where the trend reaches the extreme value, while lower values are found close to the western coasts, in correspondence of main rivers inflow. The Black Sea SST trend continues to show the highest intensity among all the other European Seas.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nSea surface temperature cumulative trend over the period 1993-2022 in the Black Sea. The cumulative trend is the rate of change (\u00b0C/year) scaled by the number of time steps (30 years). The Black Sea trend map in sea surface temperature is derived from the CMEMS SST_BS_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_022 satellite product (see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-BLKSEA-SST.pdf).

This dataset, derived from multi-sensor (SeaStar-SeaWiFS, AQUA-MODIS, NOAA20-VIIRS, NPP-VIIRS, Envisat-MERIS and Sentinel3-OLCI) Rrs spectra produced by CNR using an in-house processing chain, is obtained by means of two different regional algorithms developed with the BiOMaP data set (Zibordi et al., 2011): a band-ratio algorithm (B/R) (Zibordi et al., 2015) and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural net algorithm based on Rrs values at three individual wavelengths (490, 510 and 555 nm) (Kajiyama et al., 2018). The processing chain and the techniques used for algorithms merging are detailed in Colella et al. (2023). Monthly regional mean values are calculated by performing the average of 2D monthly mean (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. The deseasonalized time series is obtained by applying the X-11 seasonal adjustment methodology on the original time series as described in Colella et al. (2016), and then the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are subsequently applied to obtain the magnitude of trend. \n\n**CONTEXT **\n\nPhytoplankton  and chlorophyll concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton  respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Gregg and Rousseaux, 2014, Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). Therefore, it is of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the Black Sea is known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Oguz et al .2003). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the Black Sea, the trend average for the 1997-2022 period is definitely negative (-1.33\u00b11.12% per year). Nevertheless, this negative trend is lower than the one estimated in the previous release (related to 1997-2021). The negative trend is mainly due to the marked change on chlorophyll concentrations between 2002 and 2004. From 2004 onwards, minima and maxima are strongly variable year by year. However, on average, the minima/maxima variability can be considered quite constant with a continuous decrease of maxima from 2015 up to mid 2020 where signal seems to change again with relative high chlorophyll values in 2021 and 2022 (especially at the end of the year). The general negative trend in the Black Sea is also confirmed by the analysis of Sathyendranath et al. (2018), that reveals an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in all the European Seas, except for the Black Sea. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nBlack Sea time series and trend (1997-2022) of satellite chlorophyll, based on CMEMS product OCEANCOLOUR_BLK_BGC_L4_MY_009_154.

Remotely-sensed L4 SST datasets are operationally produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR-GOS). These SST products are based on the nighttime images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms, and cover the Southern European Seas. The main upstream data currently used include SLSTR-3A/3B, VIIRS-N20/NPP, Metop-B/C AVHRR and SEVIRI. The CNR-GOS processing chain includes several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at high (HR 0.0625\u00b0) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, applying statistical techniques.

The gyre boundary has been defined using a threshold value of 0.15 mg m-3 chlorophyll for the Atlantic gyres (Aiken et al. 2016), and 0.07 mg m-3 for the Pacific gyres (Polovina et al. 2008). The area inside the gyres for each month is computed using monthly chlorophyll data from which the monthly climatology is subtracted to compute anomalies. A gap filling algorithm has been utilized to account for missing data inside the gyre.  Trends in the area anomaly are then calculated for the entire study period (September 1997 to December 2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOligotrophic gyres of the oceans have been referred to as ocean deserts (Polovina et al. 2008). They are vast, covering approximately 50% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Aiken et al. 2016). Despite low productivity, these regions contribute significantly to global productivity due to their immense size (McClain et al. 2004). Even modest changes in their size can have large impacts on a variety of global biogeochemical cycles and on trends in chlorophyll (Signorini et al 2015). Based on satellite data, Polovina et al. (2008) showed that the areas of subtropical gyres were expanding. The Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) showed that the trends had reversed in the Pacific for the time segment from January 2007 to December 2016. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe trend in the North Pacific gyre area for the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period was positive, with a 1.75% increase in area relative to 2000-01-01 values. Note that this trend is lower than the 2.17% reported for the 1997-2020 period. The trend is statistically significant (p<0.05). \nDuring the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period, the trend in chlorophyll concentration was negative (-0.26% year-1) in the North Pacific gyre relative to 2000-01-01 values. This trend is slightly less negative than the trend of -0.31% year-1 for the 1997-2020 period, though the sign of the trend remains unchanged and is statistically significant (p<0.05).  It must be noted that the difference is small and within the uncertainty of the calculations, indicating that the trend is significant, however there may be no change associated with the timeseries extension.\nFor 2016, The Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) reported a large increase in gyre area in the Pacific Ocean (both North and South Pacific gyres), probably linked with the 2016 ENSO event which saw large decreases in chlorophyll in the Pacific Ocean. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00227\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aiken J, Brewin RJW, Dufois F, Polimene L, Hardman-Mountford NJ, Jackson T, Loveday B, Hoya SM, Dall\u2019Olmo G, Stephens J, et al. 2016.

The mean value over a reference period (1993-2014) and over the last full year are provided for the ensemble product and the individual reanalysis, as well as the standard deviation for the ensemble product over the reference period (1993-2014). The values are given in PetaWatt (PW).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe ocean transports heat and mass by vertical overturning and horizontal circulation, and is one of the fundamental dynamic components of the Earth\u2019s energy budget (IPCC, 2013). There are spatial asymmetries in the energy budget resulting from the Earth\u2019s orientation to the sun and the meridional variation in absorbed radiation which support a transfer of energy from the tropics towards the poles. However, there are spatial variations in the loss of heat by the ocean through sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as differences in ocean basin geometry and current systems. These complexities support a pattern of oceanic heat transport that is not strictly from lower to high latitudes. Moreover, it is not stationary and we are only beginning to unravel its variability. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nAfter an anusual 2016 year (Bricaud 2016), with a higher global meridional heat transport in the tropical band explained by, the increase of northward heat transport at 5-10 \u00b0 N in the Pacific Ocean during the El Ni\u00f1o event, 2017 northward heat transport is lower than the 1993-2014 reference value in the tropical band, for both Atlantic and Indian + Pacific Oceans. At the higher latitudes, 2017 northward heat transport is closed to 1993-2014 values.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00246\n\n**References:**\n\n* Crosnier L, Barnier B, Treguier AM, 2001.

The chlorophyll product is derived from a Multi Layer Perceptron neural-net (MLP) developed on field measurements collected within the BiOMaP program of JRC/EC (Zibordi et al., 2011). The algorithm is an ensemble of different MLPs that use Rrs at different wavelengths as input. The processing chain and the techniques used to develop the algorithm are detailed in Brando et al. (2021a; 2021b).\nThe trend map is obtained by applying Colella et al. (2016) methodology, where the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are applied on deseasonalized monthly time series, as obtained from the X-11 technique (see e. g. Pezzulli et al. 2005), to estimate, trend magnitude and its significance. The trend is expressed in % per year that represents the relative changes (i.e., percentage) corresponding to the dimensional trend [mg m-3 y-1] with respect to the reference climatology (1997-2014). Only significant trends (p < 0.05) are included.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton are key actors in the carbon cycle and, as such, recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Chlorophyll concentration - as a proxy for phytoplankton - respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response in the Baltic Sea depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Kahru and Elmgren 2014) and anthropogenic climate change. Eutrophication is one of the most important issues for the Baltic Sea (HELCOM, 2018), therefore the use of long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record is crucial for detecting eutrophication. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe average Baltic Sea trend for the 1997-2021 period is 0.5% per year. The basin shows a general positive chlorophyll trend. This result is in accordance with those of Sathyendranath et al. (2018), that reveal an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in most of the European Seas. Weak negative trends are observable in the northern sector of the Bothnian Bay and partially in the Gulf of Finland. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nBaltic Sea satellite chlorophyll trend over the period 1997-2022, based on CMEMS product OCEANCOLOUR_BAL_BGC_L3_MY_009_133.

The gyre boundary has been defined using a threshold value of 0.15 mg m-3 chlorophyll for the Atlantic gyres (Aiken et al. 2016), and 0.07 mg m-3 for the Pacific gyres (Polovina et al. 2008). The area inside the gyres for each month is computed using monthly chlorophyll data from which the monthly climatology is subtracted to compute anomalies.  A gap filling algorithm has been utilized to account for missing data. Trends in the area anomaly are then calculated for the entire study period (September 1997 to December 2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOligotrophic gyres of the oceans have been referred to as ocean deserts (Polovina et al. 2008). They are vast, covering approximately 50% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Aiken et al. 2016). Despite low productivity, these regions contribute significantly to global productivity due to their immense size (McClain et al. 2004). Even modest changes in their size can have large impacts on a variety of global biogeochemical cycles and on trends in chlorophyll (Signorini et al. 2015). Based on satellite data, Polovina et al. (2008) showed that the areas of subtropical gyres were expanding. The Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) showed that the trends had reversed in the Pacific for the time segment from January 2007 to December 2016. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe trend in the North Atlantic gyre area for the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period was positive, with a 0.14% year-1 increase in area relative to 2000-01-01 values. This trend has decreased compared with the 1997-2019 trend of 0.39%, and is no longer statistically significant (p>0.05). \nDuring the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period, the trend in chlorophyll concentration was negative (-0.21% year-1) inside the North Atlantic gyre relative to 2000-01-01 values. This is a slightly lower rate of change compared with the -0.24%  trend for the 1997-2020 period but is still statistically significant (p<0.05).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00226\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aiken J, Brewin RJW, Dufois F, Polimene L, Hardman-Mountford NJ, Jackson T, Loveday B, Hoya SM, Dall\u2019Olmo G, Stephens J, et al. 2016.

This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves.\n \nThe global wave system of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project \u00ab my wave \u00bb (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10\u00b0. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in primary and secondary swells.\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00017\n\n**References:**\n\n* F.

This dataset, derived from multi-sensor (SeaStar-SeaWiFS, AQUA-MODIS, NOAA20-VIIRS, NPP-VIIRS, Envisat-MERIS and Sentinel3-OLCI) Rrs spectra produced by CNR using an in-house processing chain, is obtained by means of the Mediterranean Ocean Colour regional algorithms: an updated version of the MedOC4 (Case 1 (off-shore) waters, Volpe et al., 2019, with new coefficients) and AD4 (Case 2 (coastal) waters, Berthon and Zibordi, 2004). The processing chain and the techniques used for algorithms merging are detailed in Colella et al. (2023). Monthly regional mean values are calculated by performing the average of 2D monthly mean (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. The deseasonalized time series is obtained by applying the X-11 seasonal adjustment methodology on the original time series as described in Colella et al. (2016), and then the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are subsequently applied to obtain the magnitude of trend.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton   and chlorophyll concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton   respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). Therefore, it is of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the Mediterranean Sea is known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Basterretxea et al. 2018, Colella et al. 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, the trend average for the 1997-2022 period is slightly negative (-0.69\u00b10.69% per year) confirm the results obtained from previous release (1997-2021). This result is in contrast with the analysis of Sathyendranath et al. (2018) that reveals an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in all the European Seas. Starting from 2010-2011, except for 2018-2019, the decrease of chlorophyll concentrations is quite evident in the deseasonalized timeseries (in green), and in the maxima of the observations (grey line), starting from 2015. This attenuation of chlorophyll values of the last decade, results in an overall negative trend for the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nMediterranean Sea time series and trend (1997-2022) of satellite chlorophyll, based on CMEMS product OCEANCOLOUR_MED_BGC_L4_MY_009_144.

The gyre boundary has been defined using a threshold value of 0.15 mg m-3 chlorophyll for the Atlantic gyres (Aiken et al. 2016), and 0.07 mg m-3 for the Pacific gyres (Polovina et al. 2008). The area inside the gyres for each month is computed using monthly chlorophyll data from which the monthly climatology is subtracted to compute anomalies. A gap filling algorithm has been utilized to account for missing data.  Trends in the area anomaly are then calculated for the entire study period (September 1997 to December 2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOligotrophic gyres of the oceans have been referred to as ocean deserts (Polovina et al. 2008). They are vast, covering approximately 50% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Aiken et al. 2016). Despite low productivity, these regions contribute significantly to global productivity due to their immense size (McClain et al. 2004). Even modest changes in their size can have large impacts on a variety of global biogeochemical cycles and on trends in chlorophyll (Signorini et al 2015). Based on satellite data, Polovina et al. (2008) showed that the areas of subtropical gyres were expanding. The Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) showed that the trends had reversed in the Pacific for the time segment from January 2007 to December 2016. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe trend in the South Pacific gyre area for the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period was positive, with a 0.04% increase in area relative to 2000-01-01 values. Note that this trend is lower than the 0.16% change for the 1997-2020 period, with the sign of the trend remaining unchanged and is not statistically significant (p<0.05).  An underlying low frequency signal is observed with a period of approximately a decade.\nDuring the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period, the trend in chlorophyll concentration was positive (0.66% year-1) in the South Pacific gyre relative to 2000-01-01 values. This rate has increased compared to the rate of  0.45% year-1 for the 1997-2020 period and remains statistically significant (p<0.05).  In the last two years of the timeseries, an increase in the variation from the mean is observed.\nFor 2016, the Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) reported a large increase in gyre area in the Pacific Ocean (both North and South Pacific gyres), probably linked with the 2016 ENSO event which saw large decreases in chlorophyll in the Pacific Ocean. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00229\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aiken J, Brewin RJW, Dufois F, Polimene L, Hardman-Mountford NJ, Jackson T, Loveday B, Hoya SM, Dall\u2019Olmo G, Stephens J, et al. 2016.

The regional thermosteric sea level values are then averaged from 60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N aiming to monitor interannual to long term global sea level variations caused by temperature driven ocean volume changes through thermal expansion as expressed in meters (m). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe global mean sea level is reflecting changes in the Earth\u2019s climate system in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing factors such as ocean warming, land ice mass loss and changes in water storage in continental river basins. Thermosteric sea-level variations result from temperature related density changes in sea water associated with volume expansion and contraction. Global thermosteric sea level rise caused by ocean warming is known as one of the major drivers of contemporary global mean sea level rise (Cazenave et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2019).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince the year 2005 the upper (0-2000m) near-global (60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N) thermosteric sea level rises at a rate of 1.3\u00b10.2 mm/year. \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00240\n\n**References:**\n\n* Oppenheimer, M., B.C.

This dataset, derived from multi-sensor (SeaStar-SeaWiFS, AQUA-MODIS, NOAA20-VIIRS, NPP-VIIRS, Envisat-MERIS and Sentinel3-OLCI) (at 1 km resolution) Rrs spectra produced by CNR using an in-house processing chain, is obtained by means of the Mediterranean Ocean Colour regional algorithms: an updated version of the MedOC4 (Case 1 (off-shore) waters, Volpe et al., 2019, with new coefficients) and AD4 (Case 2 (coastal) waters, Berthon and Zibordi, 2004). The processing chain and the techniques used for algorithms merging are detailed in Colella et al. (2023). \nThe trend map is obtained by applying Colella et al. (2016) methodology, where the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are applied on deseasonalized monthly time series, as obtained from the X-11 technique (see e. g. Pezzulli et al. 2005), to estimate, trend magnitude and its significance. The trend is expressed in % per year that represents the relative changes (i.e., percentage) corresponding to the dimensional trend [mg m-3 y-1] with respect to the reference climatology (1997-2014). Only significant trends (p < 0.05) are included.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton are key actors in the carbon cycle and, as such, recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Chlorophyll concentration - as a proxy for phytoplankton - respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). The Mediterranean Sea is an oligotrophic basin, where chlorophyll concentration decreases following a specific gradient from West to East (Colella et al. 2016). The highest concentrations are observed in coastal areas and at the river mouths, where the anthropogenic pressure and nutrient loads impact on the eutrophication regimes (Colella et al. 2016). The the use of long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record is crucial for detecting eutrophication. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nChlorophyll trend in the Mediterranean Sea, for the period 1997-2022, generally confirm trend results of the previous release with negative values over most of the basin. In Ligurian Sea, Gulf of Lion and Adriatic Sea, negative trend are slightly emphasized. Weak positive trend areas of the previous release are confirmed in the southern part of the western Mediterranean basin, Rhode Gyre and in the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. On average the trend in the Mediterranean Sea is about -0.69% per year. Contrary to what shown by Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019) in their analysis (related to 1998-2014 satellite observations), western and eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea do not show differences. In the Ligurian Sea, the trend switch to negative values, differing from the positive regime observed in the trend maps of both Colella et al. (2016) and Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019), referred, respectively, to 1998-2009 and 1998-2014 period, respectively. The waters offshore the Po River mouth show weak negative trend values, partially differing from the markable negative regime observed in the 1998-2009 period (Colella et al., 2016), and definitely moving from the positive trend observed by Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019).\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nMediterranean Sea satellite chlorophyll trend over the period 1997-2022, based on CMEMS product OCEANCOLOUR_MED_BGC_L4_MY_009_144.

This circulation varies at interannual and multidecadal time scales and it is composed of an upper zonal cell (Zonal Overturning Circulation) and two main meridional cells in the western and eastern Mediterranean (Pinardi and Masetti 2000).\nThe objective is to monitor the main water mass formation events using the eddy resolving Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis (Escudier et al. 2020, 2021) and considering Pinardi et al. (2015) and Simoncelli and Pinardi (2018) as references for the methodology. The Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis can reproduce both Eastern Mediterranean Transient and Western Mediterranean Transition phenomena and catches the principal water mass formation events reported in the literature. This will permit constant monitoring of the open ocean deep convection process in the Mediterranean Sea and a better understanding of the multiple drivers of the general overturning circulation at interannual and multidecadal time scales. \nDeep and intermediate water formation events reveal themselves by a deep mixed layer depth distribution in four Mediterranean areas (Table 1 and Figure 2): Gulf of Lions, Southern Adriatic Sea Pit, Cretan Sea and Rhodes Gyre. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) formation events in the Gulf of Lion appear to be larger after 1999 consistently with Schroeder et al. (2006, 2008) related to the Eastern Mediterranean Transient event. This modification of WMDW after 2005 has been called Western Mediterranean Transition. WMDW formation events are consistent with Somot et al. (2016) and the event in 2009 is also reported in Houpert et al. (2016). \nThe Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) formation in the Southern Adriatic Pit region displays a period of water mass formation between 1988 and 1993, in agreement with Pinardi et al. (2015), in 1996, 1999 and 2000 as documented by Manca et al. (2002). Weak deep water formation in winter 2006 is confirmed by observations in Vilibi\u0107 and \u0160anti\u0107 (2008). An intense deep water formation event is detected in 2012-2013 (Ga\u010di\u0107 et al., 2014). Last years are characterized by large events starting from 2017 (Mihanovic et al., 2021).\nCretan Intermediate Water formation rates present larger peaks between 1989 and 1993 with the ones in 1992 and 1993 composing the Eastern Mediterranean Transient phenomena. The Cretan Deep Water formed in 1992 and 1993 is characterized by the highest densities of the entire period in accordance with Velaoras et al. (2014).\nThe Levantine Deep Water formation rate in the Rhode Gyre region presents the largest values between 1992 and 1993 in agreement with Kontoyiannis et al. (1999). \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nWater mass formation rates [Sverdrup] computed in 4 regions: in the Gulf of Lion for the Western Mediterranean Deep Waters (WMDW); in the Southern Adriatic region for the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Waters (EMDW); in the Cretan Sea for the Cretan Intermediate Waters (CIW) and the Cretan Deep Waters (CDW); in the Rhode Gyre area for the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) and the Levantine Deep Waters (LDW).

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002) and the Analysis product (IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_005_001).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n\u2022\tMap of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2021).\n\u2022\tAnomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022: The 99th percentile of the year 2022 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2022 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the essential ocean variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. While the global-averaged sea surface temperatures have increased since the beginning of the 20th century (Hartmann et al., 2013) in the North Atlantic, anomalous cold conditions have also been reported since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al., 2018).\n\nThe IBI area is a complex dynamic region with a remarkable variety of ocean physical processes and scales involved. The Sea Surface Temperature field in the region is strongly dependent on latitude, with higher values towards the South (Locarnini et al. 2013). This latitudinal gradient is supported by the presence of the eastern part of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre that transports cool water from the northern latitudes towards the equator. Additionally, the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region is under the influence of the Sea Level Pressure dipole established between the Icelandic low and the Bermuda high. Therefore, the interannual and interdecadal variability of the surface temperature field may be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern (Czaja and Frankignoul, 2002; Flatau et al., 2003).\nAlso relevant in the region are the upwelling processes taking place in the coastal margins. The most referenced one is the eastern boundary coastal upwelling system off the African and western Iberian coast (Sotillo et al., 2016), although other smaller upwelling systems have also been described in the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Alvarez et al., 2011), the south-western Irish coast (Edwars et al., 1996) and the European Continental Slope (Dickson, 1980).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the IBI region, the 99th mean percentile for 1993-2021 shows a north-south pattern driven by the climatological distribution of temperatures in the North Atlantic. In the coastal regions of Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, the mean values are influenced by the upwelling processes (Sotillo et al., 2016). These results are consistent with the ones presented in \u00c1lvarez Fanjul (2019) for the period 1993-2016.\nThe 99th percentile SST anomaly in 2022 is predominantly positive, with values surpassing up to two times the climatic standard deviation. The northern half of the Atlantic domain is affected by extreme values that exceed the mean. In this region, anomalies exceeding the standard deviation are observed, particularly in the Bay of Biscay and the Northeastern Atlantic above the 45\u2070N parallel.\nIt is worth noting the Mediterranean area, where the impact of maximum sea surface temperature values exceeding two times the standard deviation is widespread. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nIberia-Biscay-Ireland Surface Temperature extreme variability: Map of the 99th mean percentile computed from the Multi Year Product (left panel) and anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022 computed from the Analysis product (right panel).

The Eulerian meridional streamfunction is evaluated by integrating meridional velocity daily data first in a vertical direction, then in a meridional direction, and finally averaging over the reanalysis period.\nThe Mediterranean overturning indices are derived for the eastern and western Mediterranean Sea by computing the annual streamfunction in the two areas separated by the Strait of Sicily around 36.5\u00b0N, and then considering the associated maxima. \nIn each case a geographical constraint focused the computation on the main region of interest. For the western index, we focused on deep-water formation regions, thus excluding both the effect of shallow physical processes and the Gibraltar net inflow. For the eastern index, we investigate the Levantine and Cretan areas corresponding to the strongest meridional overturning cell locations, thus only a zonal constraint is defined.\nTime series of annual mean values is provided for the Mediterranean Sea using the Mediterranean 1/24o eddy resolving reanalysis (Escudier et al., 2020, 2021).\nMore details can be found in the Copernicus Marine Ocean State Report issue 4 (OSR4, von Schuckmann et al., 2020) Section 2.4 (Lyubartsev et al., 2020).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe western and eastern Mediterranean clockwise meridional overturning circulation is connected to deep-water formation processes. The Mediterranean Sea 1/24o eddy resolving reanalysis (Escudier et al., 2020, 2021) is used to show the interannual variability of the Meridional Overturning Index. Details on the product are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI. \nThe Mediterranean Meridional Overturning Index is defined here as the maxima of the clockwise cells in the eastern and western Mediterranean Sea and is associated with deep and intermediate water mass formation processes that occur in specific areas of the basin: Gulf of Lion, Southern Adriatic Sea, Cretan Sea and Rhodes Gyre (Pinardi et al., 2015).\nAs in the global ocean, the overturning circulation of the western and eastern Mediterranean are paramount to determine the stratification of the basins (Cessi, 2019). In turn, the stratification and deep water formation mediate the exchange of oxygen and other tracers between the surface and the deep ocean (e.g., Johnson et al., 2009; Yoon et al., 2018). In this sense, the overturning indices are potential gauges of the ecosystem health of the Mediterranean Sea, and in particular they could instruct early warning indices for the Mediterranean Sea to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 Target 13.3.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe western and eastern Mediterranean overturning indices (WMOI and EMOI) are synthetic indices of changes in the thermohaline properties of the Mediterranean basin related to changes in the main drivers of the basin scale circulation. The western sub-basin clockwise overturning circulation is associated with the deep-water formation area of the Gulf of Lion, while the eastern clockwise meridional overturning circulation is composed of multiple cells associated with different intermediate and deep-water sources in the Levantine, Aegean, and Adriatic Seas. \nOn average, the EMOI shows higher values than the WMOI indicating a more vigorous overturning circulation in eastern Mediterranean. The difference is mostly related to the occurrence of the eastern Mediterranean transient (EMT) climatic event, and linked to a peak of the EMOI in 1992. In 1999, the difference between the two indices started to decrease because EMT water masses reached the Sicily Strait flowing into the western Mediterranean Sea (Schroeder et al., 2016). The western peak in 2006 is discussed to be linked to anomalous deep-water formation during the Western Mediterranean Transition (Smith, 2008; Schroeder et al., 2016). Thus, the WMOI and EMOI indices are a useful tool for long-term climate monitoring of overturning changes in the Mediterranean Sea. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of Mediterranean overturning indices [Sverdrup] calculated from the annual average of the meridional streamfunction over the period 1987 to 2021.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012) and the Analysis product (MEDSEA_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_006_017).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multy Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2020.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, impacting therefore on the biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2014). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions.\nThe Mediterranean Sea is an almost enclosed basin where the complexity of its orographic characteristics deeply influences the atmospheric circulation at local scale, giving rise to strong regional wind regimes (Drobinski et al. 2018). Therefore, since waves are primarily driven by winds, high waves are present over most of the Mediterranean Sea and tend to reach the highest values where strong wind and long fetch (i.e. the horizontal distance over which wave-generating winds blow) are simultaneously present (Lionello et al. 2006). Specifically, as seen in figure and in agreement with other studies (e.g. Sartini et al. 2017), the highest values (5 \u2013 6 m in figure, top) extend from the Gulf of Lion to the southwestern Sardinia through the Balearic Sea and are sustained southwards approaching the Algerian coast. They result from northerly winds dominant in the western Mediterranean Sea (Mistral or Tramontana), that become stronger due to orographic effects (Menendez et al. 2014), and act over a large area. In the Ionian Sea, the northerly Mistral wind is still the main cause of high waves (4-5 m in figure, top). In the Aegean and Levantine Seas, high waves (4-5 m in figure, top) are caused by the northerly Bora winds, prevalent in winter, and the northerly Etesian winds, prevalent in summer (Lionello et al. 2006; Chronis et al. 2011; Menendez et al. 2014). In general, northerly winds are responsible for most high waves in the Mediterranean (e.g. Chronis et al. 2011; Menendez et al. 2014). In agreement with figure (top), studies on the eastern Mediterranean and the Hellenic Seas have found that the typical wave height range in the Aegean Sea is similar to the one observed in the Ionian Sea despite the shorter fetches characterizing the former basin (Zacharioudaki et al. 2015). This is because of the numerous islands in the Aegean Sea which cause wind funneling and enhance the occurrence of extreme winds and thus of extreme waves (Kotroni et al. 2001). Special mention should be made of the high waves, sustained throughout the year, observed east and west of the island of Crete, i.e. around the exiting points of the northerly airflow in the Aegean Sea (Zacharioudaki et al. 2015). This airflow is characterized by consistently high magnitudes that are sustained during all seasons in contrast to other airflows in the Mediterranean Sea that exhibit a more pronounced seasonality (Chronis et al. 2011). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn 2020 (bottom panel), higher-than-average values of the 99th percentile of Significant Wave Height are seen over most of the northern Mediterranean Sea, in the eastern Alboran Sea, and along stretches of the African coast (Tunisia, Libya and Egypt). In many cases they exceed the climatic standard deviation. Regions where the climatic standard deviation is exceeded twice are the European and African coast of the eastern Alboran Sea, a considerable part of the eastern Spanish coast, the Ligurian Sea and part of the east coast of France as well as areas of the southern Adriatic. These anomalies correspond to the maximum positive anomalies computed in the Mediterranean Sea for year 2020 with values that reach up to 1.1 m. Spatially constrained maxima are also found at other coastal stretches (e.g. Algeri, southeast Sardinia).  Part of the positive anomalies found along the French and Spanish coast, including the coast of the Balearic Islands, can be associated with the wind storm \u201cGloria\u201d (19/1 \u2013 24/1) during which exceptional eastern winds originated in the Ligurian Sea and propagated westwards. The storm, which was of a particularly high intensity and long duration, caused record breaking wave heights in the region, and, in return, great damage to the coast (Amores et al., 2020; de Alfonso et al., 2021). Other storms that could have contributed to the positive anomalies observed in the western Mediterranean Sea include: storm Karine (25/2 \u2013 5/4), which caused high waves from the eastern coast of Spain to the Balearic Islands (Copernicus, Climate Change Service, 2020); storm Bernardo (7/11 \u2013 18/11) which also affected the Balearic islands and the Algerian coast and; storm Herv\u00e9 (2/2 \u2013 8/2) during which the highest wind gust was recorded at north Corsica (Wikiwand, 2021). In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the medicane Ianos (14/9 \u2013 21/9) may have contributed to the positive anomalies shown in the central Ionian Sea since this area coincides with the area of peak wave height values during the medicane (Copernicus, 2020a and Copernicus, 2020b). Otherwise, higher-than-average values in the figure are the result of severe, yet not unusual, wind events, which occurred during the year. Negative anomalies occur over most of the southern Mediterranean Sea, east of the Alboran Sea. The maximum negative anomalies reach about -1 m and are located in the southeastern Ionian Sea and west of the south part of mainland Greece as well as in coastal locations of the north and east Aegean  They appear to be quite unusual since they are greater than two times the climatic standard deviation in the region. They could imply less severe southerly wind activity during 2020 (Drobinski et al., 2018). \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00262\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

The Azov and Marmara Seas are not considered.\nThe quality evaluation of OMI_CLIMATE_OHC_BLKSEA_area_averaged_anomalies is based on the \u201cmulti-product\u201d approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2018), and following the MyOcean\u2019s experience (Masina et al., 2017). Three global products and one regional (Black Sea) product have been used to build an ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread. Details on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nKnowing how much and where heat energy is stored and released in the ocean is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state, variability and change, as the oceans shape our perspectives for the future.\nSeveral studies discuss a warming in the Black Sea using either observations or model results (Akpinar et al., 2017; Stanev et al. 2019; Lima et al. 2020). Using satellite sea surface temperature observations (SST), Degtyarev (2000) detected a positive temperature trend of 0.016 \u00baC years-1 in the 50-100 m layer from 1985 to 1997. From Argo floats Stanev et al. (2019) found a warming trend in the cold intermediate layer (CIL; at approximately 25 \u2013 70 m) of about 0.05 oC year-1 in recent years. The warming signal was also present in ocean heat content analyses conducted by Lima et al. (2020). Their results from the Black Sea regional reanalysis showed an increase rate of 0.880\u00b10.181 W m-2 in the upper layers (0 \u2013 200 m), which has been reflected in the disappearance of Black Sea cold intermediate layer in recent years. The newest version of reanalysis also presents a warming of 0.814\u00b10.045 W m-2 in 0 \u2013 200 m (Lima et al. (2021). This warming has been reflected in a more incidence of marine heat waves in the Black Sea over the past few years (Mohammed et al. 2022).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nTime series of ocean heat content anomalies present a significant interannual variability, altering between cool and warm events. This important characteristic becomes evident over the years 2012 to 2015: a minimum of ocean heat content anomaly is registered close to \u2013 2.00 x 108 J m-2 in 2012, followed by positive values around 2.00 x 108 J m-2 in 2013 and above 2.0 x 108 J m-2 most of time in 2014 and 2015. Since 2005 the Black Sea experienced an increase in ocean heat content (0-300 m), and record OHC values are noticed in 2020. The Black Sea is warming at a rate of 0.995\u00b10.084 W m-2, which is higher than the global average warming rate.\nThe increase in ocean heat content weakens the CIL, whereas its decreasing favours the CIL restoration (Akpinar et al., 2017). The years 2012 and 2017 exhibited a more evident warming interruption that induced a replenishment of the CIL (Lima et al. 2021).\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of the ensemble mean and ensemble spread (shaded area) of the monthly Black Sea averaged ocean heat content anomalies integrated over the 0-300m depth layer (J m\u20132) during Jan 2005 \u2013 December 2020. The monthly ocean heat content anomalies are defined as the deviation from the climatological ocean heat content mean (1993\u20132014) of each corresponding month. Mean trend values are also reported at the bottom right corner. The ensemble is based on different data products, i.e. Black Sea Reanalysis, global ocean reanalysis GLORYS12V1; global observational based products CORA5.2, ARMOR3D.

The trend detection method is based on the Census-I algorithm as described by Vantrepotte et al. (2009), where the time series is decomposed as a fixed seasonal cycle plus a linear trend component plus a residual component. The linear trend is expressed in % year -1, and its level of significance (p) calculated using a t-test. Only significant trends (p < 0.05) are included. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton are key actors in the carbon cycle and, as such, recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Chlorophyll concentration is the most widely used measure of the concentration of phytoplankton present in the ocean. Drivers for chlorophyll variability range from small-scale seasonal cycles to long-term climate oscillations and, most importantly, anthropogenic climate change. Due to such diverse factors, the detection of climate signals requires a long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe average global trend for the 1997-2021 period was 0.51% per year, with a maximum value of 25% per year and a minimum value of -6.1% per year. Positive trends are pronounced in the high latitudes of both northern and southern hemispheres. The significant increases in chlorophyll reported in 2016-2017 (Sathyendranath et al., 2018b) for the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at high latitudes appear to be plateauing after the 2021 extension.  The negative trends shown in equatorial waters in 2020 appear to be remain consistent in 2021.  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00230\n\n**References:**\n\n* Jackson, T.

The gyre boundary has been defined using a threshold value of 0.15 mg m-3 chlorophyll for the Atlantic gyres (Aiken et al. 2016), and 0.07 mg m-3 for the Pacific gyres (Polovina et al. 2008). The area inside the gyres for each month is computed using monthly chlorophyll data from which the monthly climatology is subtracted to compute anomalies.  A gap filling algorithm has been utilized to account for missing data inside the gyre. Trends in the area anomaly are then calculated for the entire study period (September 1997 to December 2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOligotrophic gyres of the oceans have been referred to as ocean deserts (Polovina et al. 2008). They are vast, covering approximately 50% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Aiken et al. 2016). Despite low productivity, these regions contribute significantly to global productivity due to their immense size (McClain et al. 2004). Even modest changes in their size can have large impacts on a variety of global biogeochemical cycles and on trends in chlorophyll (Signorini et al 2015). Based on satellite data, Polovina et al. (2008) showed that the areas of subtropical gyres were expanding. The Ocean State Report (Sathyendranath et al. 2018) showed that the trends had reversed in the Pacific for the time segment from January 2007 to December 2016.  \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe trend in the South Altantic gyre area for the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period was positive, with a 0.01% increase in area relative to 2000-01-01 values. Note that this trend is lower than the 0.09% rate for the 1997-2020 trend (though within the uncertainties associated with the two estimates) and is not statistically significant (p>0.05). \nDuring the 1997 Sept \u2013 2021 December period, the trend in chlorophyll concentration was positive (0.73% year-1) relative to 2000-01-01 values. This is a significant increase from the trend of 0.35% year-1 for the 1997-2020 period and is statistically significant (p<0.05).  The last two years of the timeseries show an increased deviation from the mean.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00228\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aiken J, Brewin RJW, Dufois F, Polimene L, Hardman-Mountford NJ, Jackson T, Loveday B, Hoya SM, Dall\u2019Olmo G, Stephens J, et al. 2016.

The chlorophyll product is derived from a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural-net (MLP) developed on field measurements collected within the BiOMaP program of JRC/EC (Zibordi et al., 2011). The algorithm is an ensemble of different MLPs that use Rrs at different wavelengths as input. The processing chain and the techniques used to develop the algorithm are detailed in Brando et al.

Chlorophyll concentration - as a proxy for phytoplankton - respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). Therefore, it is of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the Black Sea is known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Oguz et al .2003). Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe average Black Sea trend for the 1997-2022 period is absolutely similar to the previous release (1997-2021) and about -1.4% per year. The trend is negative overall the basin, with weaker values in the central area, up to no significant trend percentages. The western side of the basin highlights markable negative trend. Negative values are shown in the Azov Sea with a strong inversion offshore the Don River. The overall negative trend in the map is in accordance with the results of Bengil and Mavruk (2018), that revealed a decreasing trend of chlorophyll during the post-eutrophication phase in the years 1997-2017.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nBlack Sea satellite chlorophyll trend over the period 1997-2022, based on CMEMS product OCEANCOLOUR_BLK_BGC_L4_MY_009_154.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (IBI_MULTIYEAR_WAV_005_006) and the Analysis product (IBI_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_005_005).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n\u2022\tMap of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi-Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1993-2021).\n\u2022\tAnomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022: The 99th percentile of the year 2022 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2022.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect dramatically maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, impacting therefore on the biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2019). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions.\nThe Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region, which covers the North-East Atlantic Ocean from Canary Islands to Ireland, is characterized by two different sea state wave climate regions: whereas the northern half, impacted by the North Atlantic subpolar front, is of one of the world\u2019s greatest wave generating regions (M\u00f8rk et al., 2010; Folley, 2017), the southern half,  located at subtropical latitudes, is by contrast influenced by persistent trade winds and thus by constant and moderate wave regimes.\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which refers to changes in the atmospheric sea level pressure difference between the Azores and Iceland, is a significant driver of wave climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. The influence of North Atlantic Oscillation on waves along the Atlantic coast of Europe is particularly strong in and has a major impact on northern latitudes wintertime (Mart\u00ednez-Asensio et al. 2016; Bacon and Carter, 1991; Bouws et al., 1996; Bauer, 2001; Wolf et al., 2002; Gleeson et al., 2017). Swings in the North Atlantic Oscillation index produce changes in the storms track and subsequently in the wind speed and direction over the Atlantic that alter the wave regime. When North Atlantic Oscillation index is in its positive phase, storms usually track northeast of Europe and enhanced westerly winds induce higher than average waves in the northernmost Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, in the negative North Atlantic Oscillation phase, the track of the storms is more zonal and south than usual, with trade winds (mid latitude westerlies) being slower and producing higher than average waves in southern latitudes (Marshall et al., 2001; Wolf et al., 2002; Wolf and Woolf, 2006).   \nAdditionally a variety of previous studies have uniquevocally determined the relationship between the sea state variability in the IBI region and other atmospheric climate modes such as the East Atlantic pattern, the Arctic Oscillation, the East Atlantic Western Russian pattern and the Scandinavian pattern (Izaguirre et al., 2011, Mart\u00ednez-Asensio et al., 2016). \nIn this context, long\u2010term statistical analysis of reanalyzed model data is mandatory not only to disentangle other driving agents of wave climate but also to attempt inferring any potential trend in the number and/or intensity of extreme wave events in coastal areas with subsequent socio-economic and environmental consequences.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe climatic mean of 99th percentile (1993-2021) reveals a north-south gradient of Significant Wave Height with the highest values in northern latitudes (above 8m) and lowest values (2-3 m) detected southeastward of Canary Islands, in the seas between Canary Islands and the African Continental Shelf. This north-south pattern is the result of the two climatic conditions prevailing in the region and previously described.  \nThe 99th percentile anomalies in 2022 display a north-south dipole, with positive anomalies primarily located north of the 47\u2070N parallel. While the region of negative anomalies shows only insignificant values, the positive anomalies above 50\u2070N exhibit wide regions where their values exceed the standard deviation.\nAdditionally, the impact of significant wave extremes is detected along the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula. These maxima surpass two times the standard deviation values on the shores of the Albor\u00e1n Sea.\nConsequently, it is concluded that the maximum wave values in the IBI seas in 2022 were mainly distributed around the mean. H  owever, the incidence of positive anomalies is observed in the northern third of the domain, with highly pronounced positive anomalies along the Spanish Mediterranean coast.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nIberia-Biscay-Ireland Significant Wave Height extreme variability: Map of the 99th mean percentile computed from the Multi Year Product (left panel) and anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022 computed from the Analysis product (right panel). Transparent grey areas (if any) represent regions where anomaly exceeds the climatic standard deviation (light grey) and twice the climatic standard deviation (dark grey).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00249\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

For further details, see Lien et al. (2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Arctic Ocean contains a large amount of freshwater, and the freshwater export from the Arctic to the North Atlantic influence the stratification, and, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Aagaard et al., 1985). The Fram Strait represents the major gateway for freshwater transport from the Arctic Ocean, both as liquid freshwater and as sea ice (e.g., Vinje et al., 1998). The transport of sea ice through the Fram Strait is therefore important for the mass balance of the perennial sea-ice cover in the Arctic as it represents a large export of about 10% of the total sea ice volume every year (e.g., Rampal et al., 2011). Sea ice export through the Fram Strait has been found to explain a major part of the interannual variations in Arctic perennial sea ice volume changes (Ricker et al., 2018). The sea ice and associated freshwater transport to the Barents Sea has been suggested to be a driving mechanism for the presence of Arctic Water in the northern Barents Sea, and, hence, the presence of the Barents Sea Polar Front dividing the Barents Sea into a boreal and an Arctic part (Lind et al., 2018). In recent decades, the Arctic part of the Barents Sea has been giving way to an increasing boreal part, with large implications for the marine ecosystem and harvestable resources (e.g., Fossheim et al., 2015).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe sea-ice transport through the Fram Strait shows a distinct seasonal cycle in both sea ice area and volume transport, with a maximum in winter. There is a slight positive trend in the volume transport over the last two and a half decades. In the Barents Sea, a strong reduction of nearly 90% in average sea-ice thickness has diminished the sea-ice import from the Polar Basin (Lien et al., 2021). In both areas, the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea, the winds governed by the regional patterns of atmospheric pressure is an important driving force of temporal variations in sea-ice transport (e.g., Aaboe et al., 2021; Lien et al., 2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00192\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aaboe S, Lind S, Hendricks S, Down E, Lavergne T, Ricker R. 2021.

These trends are calculated in three ways, i.e. (i) from the annual mean values; (ii) from the March values (winter ice loss); (iii) from September values (summer ice loss).\nThe Arctic sea ice extent used here is based on the \u201cmulti-product\u201d approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (CMEMS OSR, 2017). Five global products have been used to build the ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of the sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and how much the sea ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth as sea ice is one of the highest sensitive natural environments. Variations in sea ice cover can induce changes in ocean stratification, in global and regional sea level rates and modify the key rule played by the cold poles in the Earth engine (IPCC, 2019).  \nThe sea ice cover is monitored here in terms of sea ice extent quantity. More details and full scientific evaluations can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State Report (Samuelsen et al., 2016; Samuelsen et al., 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince the year 1993 the Arctic sea ice extent has decreased significantly at an annual rate of -0.75*106 km2 per decade. This represents an amount of \u20135.8 % per decade of Arctic sea ice extent loss over the period 1993 to 2018. Summer (September) sea ice extent loss amounts to -1.18*106 km2/decade (September values), which corresponds to -14.85% per decade. Winter (March) sea ice extent loss amounts to -0.57*106 km2/decade, which corresponds to -3.42% per decade. These values slightly exceed the estimates given in the AR5 IPCC assessment report (estimate up to the year 2012) as a consequence of continuing Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent loss. Main change in the mean seasonal cycle is characterized by less and less presence of sea ice during summertime with time. The last twelve years have the twelve lowest summer minimums ever measured since 1993, the summer 2012 still being the lowest minimum. 2019 follows the recent trend of the 2010's with a summer and winter well below the 1990-2000's average. \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00190\n\n**References:**\n\n* IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

The seasonal cycle of the sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and how much the sea ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth as sea ice is one of the highest sensitive natural environments. Variations in sea ice cover can induce changes in ocean stratification and modify the key rule played by the cold poles in the Earth engine (IPCC, 2019).  \nThe sea ice cover is monitored here in terms of sea ice extent quantity. More details and full scientific evaluations can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State Report (Samuelsen et al., 2016; Samuelsen et al., 2018).\n \n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWith quasi regular highs and lows, the annual Antarctic sea ice extent shows large variability until several monthly record high in 2014 and record lows in 2017 and 2018. Since the year 1993, the Southern Hemisphere annual sea ice extent regularly alternates positive and negative trend. The period 1993-2018 have seen a slight decrease at a rate of -0.01*106km2 per decade. This represents a loss amount of 0.1% per decade of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent during this period; with however large uncertainties. The last quarter of the year 2016 and years 2017 and 2018 experienced unusual losses of ice. 2019 is not a record year, but the summer of 2019 remains among the lowest since the 1990s.  \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00186\n\n**References:**\n\n* IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

The last 2 years before now (historic best estimates) as well as forecasts of different temporal resolutions with a horizon of 5 days (updated on a daily basis) are available on the catalogue.\nThe system is based on a eddy-resolving NEMO model application at 1/36\u00ba horizontal resolution, being Mercator-Ocean in charge of the model code development. The hydrodynamic forecast includes high frequency processes of paramount importance to characterize regional scale marine processes: tidal forcing, surges and high frequency atmospheric forcing, fresh water river discharge, wave forcing in forecast, etc. A weekly update of IBI downscaled analysis is also delivered as historic IBI best estimates.\nThe product offers 3D daily and monthly ocean fields, as well as hourly mean and 15-minute instantaneous values for some surface variables. Daily and monthly averages of 3D Temperature, 3D Salinity, 3D Zonal and Meridional Velocity components, Mix Layer Depth, Sea Bottom Temperature and Sea Surface Height are provided. Additionally, hourly means of surface fields for variables such as Sea Surface Height, Mix Layer Depth, Surface Temperature and Currents, together with Barotropic Velocities are delivered. Finally, 15-minute instantaneous values of Sea Surface Height and Currents are also given.\n\n**Product Citation**: \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing [products.](http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169)\n\n**DOI (Product)**: \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00027\n\n**References:**\n\n* Sotillo, M.G.; Campuzano, F.; Guihou, K.; Lorente, P.; Olmedo, E.; Matulka, A.; Santos, F.; Amo-Baladr\u00f3n, M.A.; Novellino, A.

Remotely-sensed L4 SST datasets are operationally produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR-GOS). These SST products are based on the nighttime images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms, and cover the Southern European Seas. The main upstream data currently used include SLSTR-3A/3B, VIIRS-N20/NPP, Metop-B/C AVHRR and SEVIRI. The CNR-GOS processing chain includes several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at high (HR 0.0625\u00b0) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, applying statistical techniques. These L4 data are also used to estimate the SST anomaly with respect to a pentad climatology.

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS BS Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00157\n\n**References:**\n\n* Marullo, S., Santoleri, R., Ciani, D., Le Borgne, P., P\u00e9r\u00e9, S., Pinardi, N., ... & Nardone, G.

Many of these changes affect the hydrological cycle. Monitoring the storage of freshwater in the Arctic region is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state and variability.

SIC is the fractional area of ocean that is covered with sea ice. It is computed from Passive Microwave satellite observations since 1979. \nSIE is often reported with units of 106 km2 (millions square kilometers). The change in sea ice extent (trend) is expressed in millions of km squared per decade (106 km2/decade). In addition, trends are expressed relative to the 1979-2022 period in % per decade.\nThese trends are calculated (i) from the annual mean values; (ii) from the March values (winter ice loss); (iii) from September values (summer ice loss). The annual mean trend is reported on the key figure, the March and September values are reported in the text below.\nSIE includes all sea ice, but not lake or river ice.\nSee also section 1.7 in Samuelsen et al. (2016) for an introduction to this Ocean Monitoring Indicator (OMI).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats at the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and by how much the sea ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth. Sea ice has a significant impact on ecosystems and Arctic communities, as well as economic activities such as fisheries, tourism, and transport (Meredith et al. 2019).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince 1979, the Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent has decreased at an annual rate of -0.51 +/- 0.03106 km2 per decade (-4.41% per decade).  Loss of sea ice extent during summer exceeds the loss observed during winter periods: Summer (September) sea ice extent loss amounts to -0.81 +/- 0.06 106 km2 per decade (-12.73% per decade). Winter (March) sea ice extent loss amounts to -0.39 +/- 0.03 106 km2 per decade (-2.55% per decade). These values are in agreement with those assessed in the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (Meredith et al. 2019, with estimates up until year 2018). September 2022 had the 11th lowest mean September sea ice extent. Sea ice extent in September 2012 is to date the record minimum Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent value since the beginning of the satellite record, followed by September values in 2020.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\na) The seasonal cycle of Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2 averaged over the period 1979-2022 (red), shown together with the seasonal cycle in the year 2022 (green), and b) time series of yearly average Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2. Time series are based on satellite observations (SMMR, SSM/I, SSMIS) by EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index (v2.2) with R&D input from ESA CCI. Details on the product are given in the corresponding PUM for this OMI. The change of sea ice extent over the period 1979-2022 is expressed as a trend in millions of square kilometers per decade and is plotted with a dashed line in panel b).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00191\n\n**References:**\n\n* Samuelsen, A., L.-A.

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS MED Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n \n[How to cite](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-or-reference-copernicus-marine-products-and-services)\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00170\n\n**References:**\n\n* Marullo, S., Santoleri, R., Ciani, D., Le Borgne, P., P\u00e9r\u00e9, S., Pinardi, N., ... & Nardone, G.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

SIC is the fractional area of ocean surface that is covered with sea ice. SIC is computed from Passive Microwave satellite observations since 1979. \nSIE is often reported with units of 106 km2 (millions square kilometers). The change in sea ice extent (trend) is expressed in millions of km squared per decade (106 km2/decade). In addition, trends are expressed relative to the 1979-2022 period in % per decade.\nThese trends are calculated (i) from the annual mean values; (ii) from the September values (winter ice loss); (iii) from February values (summer ice loss). The annual mean trend is reported on the key figure, the September (maximum extent) and February (minimum extent) values are reported in the text below.\nSIE includes all sea ice, except for lake and river ice.\nSee also section 1.7 in Samuelsen et al. (2016) for an introduction to this Ocean Monitoring Indicator (OMI).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats at the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and by how much the sea-ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth (Meredith et al. 2019). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince 1979, there has been an overall slight increase of sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere but a sharp decrease was observed after 2016. Over the period 1979-2022, the annual rate amounts to +0.02 +/- 0.05 106 km2 per decade (+0.18% per decade). Winter (September) sea ice extent trend amounts to +0.06 +/- 0.05106 km2 per decade (+0.32% per decade). Summer (February) sea ice extent trend amounts to -0.01+/- 0.05 106 km2 per decade (-0.38% per decade). These trend estimates are hardly significant, which is in agreement with the IPCC SROCC, which has assessed that \u2018Antarctic sea ice extent overall has had no statistically significant trend (1979\u20132018) due to contrasting regional signals and large interannual variability (high confidence).\u2019 (IPCC, 2019). Both June and July 2022 had the lowest average sea ice extent values for these months since 1979. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\na) The seasonal cycle of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2 averaged over the period 1979-2022 (red), shown together with the seasonal cycle in the year 2022 (green), and b) time series of yearly average Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2. Time series are based on satellite observations (SMMR, SSM/I, SSMIS) by EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index (v2.2) with R&D input from ESA CCI. Details on the product are given in the corresponding PUM for this OMI. The change of sea ice extent over the period 1979-2022      is expressed as a trend in millions of square kilometers per decade and is plotted with a dashed line on panel b).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00187\n\n**References:**\n\n* Meredith, M., M.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

These observations form the basis of the gridded products included in SOCATv2023-GRIDDED: monthly, yearly and decadal averages of fCO2 over a 1x1 degree grid over the global ocean, and a 0.25x0.25 degree, monthly average for the coastal ocean.\nGLODAPv2.2023-OBS contains >1 million observations from individual seawater samples of temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and pH from 1972 to 2021. These data were subjected to an extensive quality control and bias correction described in Olsen et al. (2020). GLODAPv2-GRIDDED contains global climatologies for temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and pH over a 1x1 degree horizontal grid and 33 standard depths using the observations from the previous major iteration of GLODAP, GLODAPv2. \nSOCAT and GLODAP are based on community, largely volunteer efforts, and the data providers will appreciate that those who use the data cite the corresponding articles (see References below) in order to support future sustainability of the data products.\"\n\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.17882/99089\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bakker et al., 2016.

The products of region ARC are delivered in polar Lambertian Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG:6931, EASE2). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.    \n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1-) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided within 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor).

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The total heat content is determined using the following formula:\n\nHC =  \u03c1 * cp * ( Tp  +273.15).\n\nHere, \u03c1 and cp represent spatially varying sea water density and specific heat, respectively, which are computed based on potential temperature, salinity and pressure using the UNESCO 1983 polynomial developed by Fofonoff and Millard (1983). The vertical integral is computed using the static cell vertical thicknesses sourced from the reanalysis product BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011 dataset cmems_mod_bal_phy_my_static, spanning from the sea surface to the 300 m depth. Spatial averaging is performed over the Baltic Sea spatial domain, defined as the region between 13\u00b0 - 31\u00b0 E and 53\u00b0 - 66\u00b0 N. To obtain the OHC annual anomaly time series in (J/m2), the mean heat content over the reference period of 1993-2014 was subtracted from the annual mean total heat content.\n\nWe evaluate the uncertainty from the mean annual error of the potential temperature compared to the observations from the Baltic Sea (Giorgetti et al., 2020). The shade corresponds to the RMSD of the annual mean heat content biases (\u00b1 35.3 MJ/m\u00b2) evaluated from the observed temperatures and corresponding model values.\n\nLinear trend (W/m2) has been estimated from the annual anomalies with the uncertainty of 1.96-times standard error.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOcean heat content is a key ocean climate change indicator. It accounts for the energy absorbed and stored by oceans. Ocean Heat Content in the upper 2,000 m of the World Ocean has increased with the rate of 0.35 \u00b1 0.08 W/m2 in the period 1955\u20132019, while during the last decade of 2010\u20132019 the warming rate was 0.70 \u00b1 0.07 W/m2 (Garcia-Soto et al., 2021). The high variability in the local climate of the Baltic Sea region is attributed to the interplay between a temperate marine zone and a subarctic continental zone. Therefore, the Ocean Heat Content of the Baltic Sea could exhibit strong interannual variability and the trend could be less pronounced than in the ocean.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOcean heat content of the Baltic Sea has an increasing trend of 0.3\u00b10.1 W/m2 superimposed with multi-year oscillations. The OHC increase in the Baltic Sea is smaller than the global OHC trend (Holland et al. 2019; von Schuckmann et al. 2019) and in some other marginal seas (von Schuckmann et al. 2018; Lima et al. 2020). Trend values are low due to the shallowness of the Baltic Sea, which limits the accumulation of heat in the water. The highest ocean heat content anomaly was observed in 2020. During the last two years, the heat content anomaly has decreased from its peak value.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nThe time series of horizontally averaged ocean heat content anomaly integrated over 0-300 m depth, for the period of 1993-2022. The temperature from Copernicus Marine Service regional reanalysis product (BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011) have been averaged over the Baltic Sea domain (13 \u00b0E - 31 \u00b0E; 53 \u00b0N - 66 \u00b0N; excluding the Skagerrak strait). The shaded area shows the estimated RMSD interval of annual heat content biases.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00322\n\n**References:**\n\n* Garcia-Soto C, Cheng L, Caesar L, Schmidtko S, Jewett EB, Cheripka A, Rigor I, Caballero A, Chiba S, B\u00e1ez JC, Zielinski T and Abraham JP (2021) An Overview of Ocean Climate Change Indicators: Sea Surface Temperature, Ocean Heat Content, Ocean pH, Dissolved Oxygen Concentration, Arctic Sea Ice Extent, Thickness and Volume, Sea Level and Strength of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation).

The index was computed using sea surface current speed averaged over two areas of intense currents based on reanalysis data. The areas are confined between the 200 and 1800 m isobaths in the northern section 33-39E (from the Caucasus coast to the Crimea Peninsula), and in the southern section 31.5-35E (from Sakarya region to near Sinop Peninsula). Thus, three indices were defined: one for the northern section (BSRCIn), for the southern section (BSRCIs) and an average for the entire basin (BSRCI).\nBSRCI=(V \u0305_ann-V \u0305_cl)/V \u0305_cl \nwhere V \u0305 denotes the representative area average, the \u201cann\u201d denotes the annual mean for each individual year in the analysis, and \u201ccl\u201d indicates the long-term mean over the whole period 1993-2020. In general, BSRCI is defined as the relative annual anomaly from the long-term mean speed.  An index close to zero means close to the average conditions a positive index indicates that the Rim current is more intense than average, or negative - if it is less intense than average. In other words, positive BSRCI would mean higher circumpolar speed, enhanced baroclinicity, enhanced dispersion of pollutants, less degree of exchange between open sea and coastal areas, intensification of the heat redistribution, etc.\nThe BSRCI is introduced in the fifth issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2021). The Black Sea Physics Reanalysis (BLKSEA_REANALYSIS_PHYS_007_004) has been used as a data base to build the index. Details on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Black Sea circulation is driven by the regional winds and large freshwater river inflow in the north-western part (including the main European rivers Danube, Dnepr and Dnestr). The major cyclonic gyre encompasses the sea, referred to as Rim current. It is quasi-geostrophic and the Sverdrup balance approximately applies to it. \nThe Rim current position and speed experiences significant interannual variability (Stanev and Peneva, 2002), intensifying in winter due to the dominating severe northeastern winds in the region (Stanev et al., 2000). Consequently, this impacts the vertical stratification, Cold Intermediate Water formation, the biological activity distribution and the coastal mesoscale eddies\u2019 propagation along the current and their evolution. The higher circumpolar speed leads to enhanced dispersion of pollutants, less degree of exchange between open sea and coastal areas, enhanced baroclinicity, intensification of the heat redistribution which is important for the winter freezing in the northern zones (Simonov and Altman, 1991). Fach (2015) finds that the anchovy larval dispersal in the Black Sea is strongly controlled at the basin scale by the Rim Current and locally - by mesoscale eddies. \nSeveral recent studies of the Black Sea pollution claim that the understanding of the Rim Current behavior and how the mesoscale eddies evolve would help to predict the transport of various pollution such as oil spills (Korotenko, 2018) and floating marine litter (Stanev and Ricker, 2019) including microplastic debris (Miladinova et al., 2020) raising a serious environmental concern today. \nTo summarize, the intensity of the Black Sea Rim Current could give valuable integral measure for a great deal of physical and biogeochemical processes manifestation. Thus our objective is to develop a comprehensive index reflecting the annual mean state of the Black Sea general circulation to be used by policy makers and various end users. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Black Sea Rim Current Index is defined as the relative annual anomaly of the long-term mean speed. The BSRCI value characterizes the annual circulation state: a value close to zero would mean close to average conditions, positive value indicates enhanced circulation, and negative value \u2013 weaker circulation than usual. The time-series of the BSRCI suggest that the Black Sea Rim current speed varies within ~30% in the period 1993-2020 with a positive trend of ~0.1 m/s/decade. In the years 2005 and 2014 there is evidently higher mean velocity, and on the opposite end are the years \u20132004, 2013 and 2016. The time series of the BSRCI gives possibility to check the relationship with the wind vorticity and validate the Sverdrup balance hypothesis. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of the Black Sea Rim Current Index (BSRCI) at the north section (BSRCIn), south section (BSRCIs), the average (BSRCI) and its tendency for the period 1993-2020.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00326\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capet, A., A.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The change in the reprocessed version (previously DT-2018) and the extension of the mean value of the EKE (now 27 years, previously 20 years) induce some slight changes not impacting the general variability of the Kuroshio extension (correlation coefficient of 0.988 for the total period, 0.994 for the delayed time period only). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Kuroshio Extension is an eastward-flowing current in the subtropical western North Pacific after the Kuroshio separates from the coast of Japan at 35\u00b0N, 140\u00b0E. Being the extension of a wind-driven western boundary current, the Kuroshio Extension is characterized by a strong variability and is rich in large-amplitude meanders and energetic eddies (Niiler et al., 2003; Qiu, 2003, 2002). The Kuroshio Extension region has the largest sea surface height variability on sub-annual and decadal time scales in the extratropical North Pacific Ocean (Jayne et al., 2009; Qiu and Chen, 2010, 2005). Prediction and monitoring of the path of the Kuroshio are of huge importance for local economies as the position of the Kuroshio extension strongly determines the regions where phytoplankton and hence fish are located. Unstable (contracted) phase of the Kuroshio enhance the production of Chlorophyll (Lin et al., 2014).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe different states of the Kuroshio extension phase have been presented and validated by (Bessi\u00e8res et al., 2013) and further reported by Dr\u00e9villon et al. (2018) in the Copernicus Ocean State Report #2. Two rather different states of the Kuroshio extension are observed: an \u2018elongated state\u2019 (also called \u2018strong state\u2019) corresponding to a narrow strong steady jet, and a \u2018contracted state\u2019 (also called \u2018weak state\u2019) in which the jet is weaker and more unsteady, spreading on a wider latitudinal band. When the Kuroshio Extension jet is in a contracted (elongated) state, the upstream Kuroshio Extension path tends to become more (less) variable and regional eddy kinetic energy level tends to be higher (lower). In between these two opposite phases, the Kuroshio extension jet has many intermediate states of transition and presents either progressively weakening or strengthening trends. In 2018, the indicator reveals an elongated state followed by a weakening neutral phase since then.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nStandardized Eddy Kinetic Energy over the Kuroshio region (following Bessi\u00e8res et al., 2013) Blue shaded areas correspond to well established strong elongated states periods, while orange shaded areas fit weak contracted states periods. The ocean monitoring indicator is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) completed by DUACS near Real Time (\u201cnrt\u201d) sea level multi-mission gridded products.

The products of region ARC are delivered in polar Lambertian Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG:6931, EASE2). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

It is expressed in PgC per year. The ocean monitoring index is presented for the period 1985 to year-1. The yearly estimate of the ocean CO2 sink corresponds to the mean of a 100-member ensemble of CO2 flux estimates (Chau et al. 2022). The range of an estimate with the associated uncertainty is then defined by the empirical 68% interval computed from the ensemble.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSince the onset of the industrial era in 1750, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased from about 277\u00b13 ppm (Joos and Spahni, 2008) to 412.44\u00b10.1 ppm in 2020 (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2020). By 2011, the ocean had absorbed approximately 28 \u00b1 5% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus providing negative feedback to global warming and climate change (Ciais et al., 2013). The ocean CO2 sink is evaluated every year as part of the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2022). The uptake of CO2 occurs primarily in response to increasing atmospheric levels. The global flux is characterized by a significant variability on interannual to decadal time scales largely in response to natural climate variability (e.g., ENSO) (Friedlingstein et al. 2022, Chau et al. 2022). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe rate of change of the integrated yearly surface downward flux has increased by 0.04\u00b10.03e-1 PgC/yr2 over the period 1985 to year-1. The yearly flux time series shows a plateau in the 90s followed by an increase since 2000 with a growth rate of 0.06\u00b10.04e-1 PgC/yr2. In  2021 (resp. 2020), the global ocean CO2 sink was    2.41\u00b10.13 (resp.  2.50\u00b10.12) PgC/yr. The average over the full period is 1.61\u00b10.10 PgC/yr with an interannual variability (temporal standard deviation) of 0.46 PgC/yr.  In order to compare these fluxes to Friedlingstein et al. (2022), the estimate of preindustrial outgassing of riverine carbon of  0.61 PgC/yr, which is in between the estimate by Jacobson et al. (2007) (0.45\u00b10.18 PgC/yr) and the one by Resplandy et al. (2018) (0.78\u00b10.41 PgC/yr) needs to be added. A full discussion regarding this OMI can be found in section 2.10 of the Ocean State Report 4 (Gehlen et al., 2020) and in Chau et al.

Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990\u2019s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one metre by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves.\nThe Iberian Biscay Ireland region shows positive sea level trend modulated by decadal-to-multidecadal variations driven by ocean dynamics and superposed to the long-term trend (Chafik et al., 2019).\n\n** KEY FINDINGS**\nThe completeness index criteria is fulfilled by 55 stations in 2021, three more than those  available in 2020 (52), recently added to the multi-year product  INSITU_GLO_PHY_SSH_DISCRETE_MY_013_053. The mean 99th percentiles reflect the great tide spatial variability around the UK and the north of France. Minimum values are observed in the Irish coast (e.g.: 0.66 m above mean sea level in Arklow Harbour), South of England (e.g.: 0.70 m above mean sea level in Bournemouth), and the Canary Islands (e.g.: 0.96 m above mean sea level in Hierro). Maximum values are observed in the Bristol and English Channels (e.g.: 6.26 m and 5.17 m above mean sea level in Newport and St. Helier, respectively). The standard deviation reflects the south-north increase of storminess, ranging between 2 cm in the Canary Islands to 12 cm in Newport (Bristol Channel). Negative or close to zero anomalies of 2021 99th percentile are observed this year for most of the stations in the region, reaching up to -17.8 cm  in Newport, or -15 cm in St.Helier (Jersey Island, Channel Islands).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00253\n\n**References:**\n\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.

The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nFor the Mediterranean Sea an interesting publication (De Leo et al., 2024) analyses recent studies in this basin showing the variability in the different results and the difficulties to reach a consensus, especially in the mean wave conditions. The only significant conclusion is the positive trend in extreme values for the western Mediterranean Sea and in particular in the Gulf of Lion and in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00265\n\n**References:**\n\n* De Leo F, Briganti R & Besio G. 2024.

In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Baltic Sea has showed in the last two decades a warming trend across the whole basin with more frequent and severe heat waves (IPCC, 2022). This trend is significantly higher when considering only the summer season, which would affect the high extremes (e.g. H\u00f8yer and Karagali, 2016).\n\n** KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area go from 18.9\u00baC in Slipshavn to 21.0\u00baC around the Zealand Region, and the standard deviation ranges between 1\u00baC and 5\u00baC reached in the Estonian Coast.\nResults for this year show a general positive anomaly. This anomaly is noticeable in Rohukula and Virtsu tide gauges (Estonia) with +5\u00baC and +4.8\u00baC, but inside the standard deviation in both locations. The positive anomaly is remarkable in the South Baltic, in the area of Denmark Islands with an anomaly of +3.0\u00baC in Slipshavn and 1.2\u00baC of standard deviation and +2.2\u00baC of anomaly and 1.1\u00baC of standard deviation in Fynshavn and also in Greifswalder Island (+2.5\u00baC of anomaly; 1.7\u00baC of standard deviation). In the rest of the Baltic the anomaly, even when positive, is under the margin of the standard deviation. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00204\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

It is computed for the variable sea surface temperature measured by in situ buoys at depths between 0 and 5 meters. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is one of the essential ocean variables affected by climate change (mean SST trends, SST spatial and interannual variability, and extreme events). In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann et al., 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Mediterranean Sea has showed a constant increase of the SST in the last three decades across the whole basin with more frequent and severe heat waves (Juza et al., 2022). Deep analyses of the variations have displayed a non-uniform rate in space, being the warming trend more evident in the eastern Mediterranean Sea with respect to the western side. This variation rate is also changing in time over the three decades with differences between the seasons (e.g. Pastor et al. 2018; Pisano et al. 2020), being higher in Spring and Summer, which would affect the extreme values.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present values from 25\u00baC in Ionian Sea and 26\u00ba in the Alboran sea and Gulf of Lion to 27\u00baC in the East of Iberian Peninsula. The standard deviation ranges from 0.6\u00baC to 1.2\u00baC in the Western Mediterranean and is around 2.2\u00baC in the Ionian Sea.\nResults for this year show a slight positive anomaly in the South-East of the Spanish Coast +0.7\u00baC) and the Ionian Sea (+0.6\u00baC), and a slight negative anomaly in the North-East of the Iberian Peninsula and Gulf of Lion (-0,8\u00baC), all of them inside the range of the standard deviation.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00267\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

This indicator is derived from monthly pH time series distributed with the Copernicus Marine product MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008 (Chau et al., 2022a). For each grid cell, a linear least-squares regression was used to fit a linear function of pH versus time, where the slope (\u03bc) and residual standard deviation (\u03c3) are defined as estimates of the long-term trend and associated uncertainty. Finally, the estimates of pH associated with the highest uncertainty, i.e.,  \u03c3-to-\u00b5 ratio over a threshold of 1  0%, are excluded from the global trend map (see QUID document for detailed description and method illustrations). This threshold is chosen at the 90th confidence level of all ratio values computed across the global ocean.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nA decrease in surface ocean pH (i.e., ocean acidification) is primarily a consequence of an increase in ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations that have been augmented by anthropogenic emissions (Bates et al, 2014; Gattuso et al, 2015; P\u00e9rez et al, 2021).      As projected in Gattuso et al (2015), \u201cunder our current rate of emissions, most marine organisms evaluated will have very high risk of impacts by 2100 and many by 2050\u201d. Ocean acidification is thus an ongoing source of concern due to its strong influence on marine ecosystems (e.g., Doney et al., 2009; Gehlen et al., 2011; P\u00f6rtner et al. 2019). Tracking changes in yearly mean values of surface ocean pH at the global scale has become an important indicator of both ocean acidification and global change (Gehlen et al., 2020; Chau et al., 2022b). In line with a sustained establishment of ocean measuring stations and thus a rapid increase in observations of ocean pH and other carbonate variables (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and CO2 fugacity) since the last decades (Bakker et al., 2016; Lauvset et al., 2021), recent studies including Bates et al (2014), Lauvset et al (2015), and P\u00e9rez et al (2021) put attention on analyzing secular trends of pH and their drivers from time-series stations to ocean basins. This OMI consists of the global maps of long-term pH trends and associated 1\u03c3-uncertainty derived from the Copernicus Marine data-based product of monthly surface water pH (Chau et al., 2022a) at 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 grid cells over the global ocean.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince 1985, pH has been decreasing at a rate between -0.0008 yr-1 and -0.0022 yr-1 over most of the global ocean basins. Tropical and subtropical regions, the eastern equatorial Pacific excepted, show pH trends falling in the interquartile range of all the trend estimates (between -0.0012 yr-1 and -0.0018 yr-1). pH over the eastern equatorial Pacific decreases much faster, reaching a growth rate larger than -0.0024 yr-1. Such a high rate of change in pH is also observed over a sector south of the Indian Ocean. Part of the polar and subpolar North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean has no significant trend.  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00277\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bakker, D. C.

The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nFor the Mediterranean Sea an interesting publication (De Leo et al., 2024) analyses recent studies in this basin showing the variability in the different results and the difficulties to reach a consensus, especially in the mean wave conditions. The only significant conclusion is the positive trend in extreme values for the western Mediterranean Sea and in particular in the Gulf of Lion and in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a range from 1.5-3.5 in the Gibraltar Strait and Alboran Sea with 0.25-0.6 of standard deviation (std), 2-4m in the East coast of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands with 0.2-0.4m of std, 3-4m in the Aegean Sea with 0.4m of std to 4-5m in the Gulf of Lyon with 0.3-0.5m of std. \nResults for this year show slight either negative or positive anomalies in the whole area from -0.45m to +0.4m, all of them around the standard deviation range.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00263\n\n**References:**\n\n* Goda Y. 2010.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and adjacent  seas Sea weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and regional mean GIA correction (weighted GIA mean of a 27 ensemble model following Spada et Melini, 2019). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.\nUncertainty is provided in a 90% confidence interval. It is calculated as the weighted mean uncertainties in the region from Prandi et al., 2021. This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation depending on the period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nIn this region, sea level variations are influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (e.g. Chafik et al., 2019). Hermans et al., 2020 also reported the dominant influence of wind on interannual sea level variability in a large part of this area. This region encompasses the Mediterranean, IBI, North-West shelf and Baltic regions with different sea level dynamics detailed in the regional indicators.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and adjacent  seas area rises at a rate of 3.2 \u00b1 0.80 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00335\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

It is computed for the variable significant wave height (swh) measured by in situ buoys. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nProjections on Climate Change foresee a future with a greater frequency of extreme sea states (Stott, 2016; Mitchell, 2006). The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nIn the North Atlantic, the mean wave height shows some weak trends not very statistically significant. Young & Ribal (2019) found a mostly positive weak trend in the European Coasts while Timmermans et al.  (2020) showed a weak negative trend in high latitudes, including the North Sea and even more intense in the Norwegian Sea. For extreme values, some authors have found a clearer positive trend in high percentiles (90th-99th) (Young, 2011; Young & Ribal, 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a wide range from 2-3m in the Canary Island with 0.1-0.3 m of standard deviation (std), 3.5m in the Gulf of Cadiz with 0.5m of std, 3-6m in the English Channel and the Irish Sea 0.5-0.6m of std, 4-7.5m in the Bay of Biscay with 0.4-0.9m of std to 8-9m in the West of the British Isles with 0.5-0.8m of std. \nResults for this year show close to zero anomalies in the Canary Island (-0.08/+0.02m), slight negative anomaly in the Gulf of Cadiz (-0.4m), slight positive anomaly in the Irish Sea (+0.35m), all of them inside the range of the standard deviation  and general negative anomaly in the rest of the area, with some values reaching -1.0 meter of anomaly (barely out of the standard deviation range).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00250\n\n**References:**\n\n* Goda Y. 2010.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the Baltic Sea weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and regional mean GIA correction (weighted GIA mean of a 27 ensemble model following Spada et Melini, 2019). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.\nThe trend uncertainty is provided in a 90% confidence interval. It is calculated as the weighted mean uncertainties in the region from Prandi et al., 2021. This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation considering to the altimeter period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nThe Baltic Sea is a relatively small semi-enclosed basin with shallow bathymetry. Different forcings have been discussed to trigger sea level variations in the Baltic Sea at different time scales. In addition to steric effects, decadal and longer sea level variability in the basin can be induced by sea water exchange with the North Sea, and in response to atmospheric forcing and climate variability (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation; Gr\u00e4we et al., 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Baltic Sea rises at a rate of 4.1 \uf0b1 0.8 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.10 \uf0b1\uf0200.07 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00202\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

Evolution of the salt content may have an impact in the ocean circulation and dynamics which possibly will have implication on the entire Earth climate system.

The cumulative trend is the rate of change (\u00b0C/year) scaled by the number of years (30 years). The SST/IST Level 4 analysis that provides the input to the trend calculations are taken from the reprocessed product SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 with a recent update to include 2022. The product has a spatial resolution of 0.05   degrees in latitude and longitude.\nSince the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 is currently only available until the 30th June 2022, an adjusted version of the SEAICE_ARC_SEAICE_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_011_008 product has been used for the rest of 2022. The adjustment is based on the biases between the NRT and reprocessed product during the second half of 2021 and was made to ensure consistency in the OMIs. \nThe OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1993 to December 31, 2022 and is constructed by calculating monthly averages from the daily level 4 SST/IST analysis fields of the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 product from 1993 to 2022.   See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018) for more information on the temperature OMI   product. The times series of monthly anomalies have been used to calculate the trend in surface temperature (combined SST and IST) using Sen\u2019s method with confidence intervals from the Mann-Kendall test (section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSST and IST are essential climate variables that act as important input for initializing numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and monitoring climate change. Especially in the Arctic, SST/IST feedbacks amplify climate change (AMAP, 2021). In the Arctic Ocean, the surface temperatures play a crucial role for the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, sea ice growth and melt processes (Key et al., 1997) in addition to weather and sea ice forecasts through assimilation into ocean and atmospheric models (Rasmussen et al., 2018). \nThe Arctic Ocean is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST and IST records and the assessment of climatic variability due to the presence of both seawater and ice, and the large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the sea ice cover which lead to increased complexity in the SST mapping of the Arctic region. Combining SST and ice surface temperature (IST) is identified as the most appropriate method for determining the surface temperature of the Arctic (Minnett et al., 2020).  \nPreviously, climate trends have been estimated individually for SST and IST records (Bulgin et al., 2020; Comiso and Hall, 2014). However, this is problematic in the Arctic region due to the large temporal variability in the sea ice cover including the overlying northward migration of the ice edge on decadal timescales, and thus, the resulting climate trends are not easy to interpret (Comiso, 2003). A combined surface temperature dataset of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone (MIZ)   provides a consistent climate indicator, which is important for studying climate trends in the Arctic region.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSST/IST trends were calculated for the Arctic Ocean over the period January 1993 to December 2022. The cumulative trends are upwards of 2\u00b0C for the greatest part of the Arctic Ocean, with the largest trends occur in the north Barents Sea, Kara Sea and the Eurasian part of the Arctic Ocean. Zero to slightly negative trends are found at the North Atlantic part of the Arctic Ocean. The combined sea and sea ice surface temperature  trend is 0.122+/-0.008\u00b0C/yr, i.e. an increase by around 3.66\u00b0C between 1982 and 2022. The 2d map of Arctic anomalies reveals regional peak warmings exceeding 10\u00b0C.  \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nCumulative trends in combined sea and sea-ice surface temperature anomalies calculated from 1993 to 2022 for the Arctic Ocean (OMI_CLIMATE_sst_ist_ARCTIC_sst_ist_trend). Trend calculations are based on the multi-year Arctic Ocean L4 SST/IST satellite product SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00324\n\n**References:**\n\n* AMAP, 2021.

It is computed for the variable sea level measured by tide gauges along the coast. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The annual percentiles referred to annual mean sea level are temporally averaged and their spatial evolution is displayed in the dataset northwestshelf_omi_sl_extreme_var_slev_mean_and_anomaly_obs, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea level (SLEV) is one of the Essential Ocean Variables most affected by climate change. Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990\u2019s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one metre by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves. \nThe North West Shelf area presents positive sea level trends with higher trend estimates in the German Bight and around Denmark, and lower trends around the southern part of Great Britain (Dettmering et al., 2021).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe completeness index criteria is fulfilled in this region by 26 stations, three more than in 2020 (23). The mean 99th percentiles present a large spatial variability related to the tidal pattern, ranging from the 3.08 m above mean sea level in Immingan (East England)  to 0.58 m above mean sea level in Ringhals (Sweden). The standard deviation ranges between 3 cm in the western part of the region (Sheerness, Lerwick or Dunkerke) and 8 cm in the eastern part and the Kattegat (e.g. Hornbaek, Denmark). All the stations show negative or close to zero anomalies in 2021, reaching larger negative values along the Swedish coast (up to -13 cm in Ringhals) and the North of Scotland (-10 cm in Ullapool).  This negative anomaly is significantly smaller in the Southern part of the region (e.g. close to zero in Dover).   \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00272\n\n**References:**\n\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.

The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nProjections on Climate Change foresee a future with a greater frequency of extreme sea states (Stott, 2016; Mitchell, 2006). The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nIn the Baltic Sea, the particular bathymetry and geography of the basin intensify the seasonal and spatial fluctuations in wave conditions. No clear statistically significant trend in the sea state has been appreciated except a rising trend in significant wave height in winter season, linked with the reduction of sea ice coverage (Soomere, 2023; Tuomi et al., 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area are from 3 meters close to Zealand Island to 4 meters in Northern Baltic station in front of the Gulf of Finland and the standard deviation ranges from 0.2 m to 0.35 m. \nResults for this year show a slight negative anomaly in all the stations, with +0.45 m in Northern Baltic platform and around +0.2 m, inside the margin of the standard deviation, in the other two stations.  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00199\n\n**References:**\n\n* Goda Y. 2010.

At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022b). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022c). \nIn the Black Sea, major drivers of change have been attributed to  anthropogenic climate change (steric expansion), and mass changes induced by various water exchanges with the Mediterranean Sea, river discharge, and precipitation/evaporation changes (e.g. Volkov and Landerer, 2015). The sea level variation in the basin also shows an important interannual variability, with an increase observed before 1999 predominantly linked to steric effects, and comparable lower values afterward (Vigo et al., 2005).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Black Sea rises at a rate of 1.00 \u00b1 0.80 mm/year with an acceleration of -0.47 \u00b1 0.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00215\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nBeside a clear long-term trend, the regional mean sea level variation in the Mediterranean Sea shows an important interannual variability, with a high trend observed between 1993 and 1999 (nearly 8.4 mm/y) and relatively lower values afterward (nearly 2.4 mm/y between 2000 and 2022). This variability is associated with a variation of the different forcing. Steric effect has been the most important forcing before 1999 (Fenoglio-Marc, 2002; Vigo et al., 2005). Important change of the deep-water formation site also occurred in the 90\u2019s. Their influence contributed to change the temperature and salinity property of the intermediate and deep water masses. These changes in the water masses and distribution is also associated with sea surface circulation changes, as the one observed in the Ionian Sea in 1997-1998 (e.g. Ga\u010di\u0107 et al., 2011), under the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases (Incarbona et al., 2016). These circulation changes may also impact the sea level trend in the basin (Vigo et al., 2005). In 2010-2011, high regional mean sea level has been related to enhanced water mass exchange at Gibraltar, under the influence of wind forcing during the negative phase of NAO (Landerer and Volkov, 2013).The relatively high contribution of both sterodynamic (due to steric and circulation changes) and gravitational, rotational, and deformation (due to mass and water storage changes) after 2000 compared to the [1960, 1989] period is also underlined by (Calafat et al., 2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Mediterranean Sea rises at a rate of 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.01 \u00b1 0.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00264\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the Global Ocean weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and global GIA correction of -0.3mm/yr (common global GIA correction, see Spada, 2017). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.\nThe trend uncertainty of 0.3 mm/yr is provided at 90% confidence interval using altimeter error budget (Gu\u00e9rou et al., 2022). This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation depending on the period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers(WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). According to the recent IPCC 6th assessment report (IPCC WGI, 2021), global mean sea level (GMSL) increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901 to 2018 with a rate of rise that has accelerated since the 1960s to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm/yr for the period 2006\u20132018. Human activity was very likely the main driver of observed GMSL rise since 1970 (IPCC WGII, 2021). The weight of the different contributions evolves with time and in the recent decades the mass change has increased, contributing to the on-going acceleration of the GMSL trend (IPCC, 2022a; Legeais et al., 2020; Horwath et al., 2022). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022b). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022c).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, global mean sea level  rises at a rate of 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 mm/year. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the Topex-A drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and global GIA correction (Spada, 2017) to consider the ongoing movement of land. The observed global trend agrees with other recent estimates (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; IPCC WGI, 2021). About 30% of this rise can be attributed to ocean thermal expansion (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; von Schuckmann et al., 2018), 60% is due to land ice melt from glaciers and from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. The remaining 10% is attributed to changes in land water storage, such as soil moisture, surface water and groundwater. From year to year, the global mean sea level record shows significant variations related mainly to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00237\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

The cumulative trend is the rate of change (\u00b0C/year) scaled by the number of years (30 years). The SST Level 4 analysis products that provide the input to the trend calculations are taken from the reprocessed product SST_BAL_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_016 with a recent update to include 2022. The product has a spatial resolution of 0.02 in latitude and longitude.\nThe OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1993 to December 31, 2022 and is constructed by calculating monthly averages from the daily level 4 SST analysis fields of the SST_BAL_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_016 from 1993 to 2022. See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports for more information on the OMI product (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018). The times series of monthly anomalies have been used to calculate the trend in SST using Sen\u2019s method with confidence intervals from the Mann-Kendall test (section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSST is an essential climate variable that is an important input for initialising numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and monitoring climate change. The Baltic Sea is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST records and the assessment of climatic variability (H\u00f8yer and She 2007; H\u00f8yer and Karagali 2016). The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed basin with natural variability and it is influenced by large-scale atmospheric processes and by the vicinity of land. In addition, the Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world. When analysing regional-scale climate variability, all these effects have to be considered, which requires dedicated regional and validated SST products. Satellite observations have previously been used to analyse the climatic SST signals in the North Sea and Baltic Sea (BACC II Author Team 2015; Lehmann et al. 2011). Recently, H\u00f8yer and Karagali (2016) demonstrated that the Baltic Sea had warmed 1-2oC from 1982 to 2012 considering all months of the year and 3-5oC when only July- September months were considered. This was corroborated in the Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSST trends were calculated for the Baltic Sea area and the whole region including the North Sea, over the period January 1993 to December 2022. The average trend for the Baltic Sea domain (east of 9\u00b0E longitude) is 0.048\u00b0C/year, which represents an average warming of 1.44\u00b0C for the 1993-2022 period considered here. When the North Sea domain is included, the trend decreases to 0.029\u00b0C/year corresponding to an average warming of 0.87\u00b0C for the 1993-2022 period. Trends are highest for the Baltic Sea region and North Atlantic, especially offshore from Norway, compared to other regions. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nCumulative trends in sea surface temperature anomalies calculated from 1993 to 2022 for the Baltic Sea (OMI_CLIMATE_SST_BAL_trend).

The SST/IST Level 4 analysis products that provide the input to the monthly averages are taken from the reprocessed product SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 with a recent update to include 2022. The product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees in latitude and longitude. Since the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 is currently only available until the 30th June 2022, an adjusted version of the SEAICE_ARC_SEAICE_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_011_008 product has been used for the rest of 2022. The adjustment is based on the biases between the NRT and reprocessed product during the second half of 2021 and was made to ensure consistency in the OMIs\nThe OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1993 to December 31, 2022 and is constructed by calculating monthly average anomalies from the reference climatology from 1993 to 2014, using the daily level 4 SST analysis fields of the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 product.   See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018) for more information on the temperature OMI   product. The times series of monthly anomalies have been used to calculate the trend in surface temperature (combined SST and IST) using Sen\u2019s method with confidence intervals from the Mann-Kendall test (section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSST and IST are essential climate variables that act as important input for initializing numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and monitoring climate change. Especially in the Arctic, SST/IST feedbacks amplify climate change (AMAP, 2021). In the Arctic Ocean, the surface temperatures play a crucial role for the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, sea ice growth and melt processes (Key et al, 1997) in addition to weather and sea ice forecasts through assimilation into ocean and atmospheric models (Rasmussen et al., 2018). \nThe Arctic Ocean is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST and IST records and the assessment of climatic variability due to the presence of both seawater and ice, and the large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the sea ice cover which lead to increased complexity in the SST mapping of the Arctic region. Combining SST and ice surface temperature (IST) is identified as the most appropriate method for determining the surface temperature of the Arctic (Minnett et al., 2020).  \nPreviously, climate trends have been estimated individually for SST and IST records (Bulgin et al., 2020; Comiso and Hall, 2014). However, this is problematic in the Arctic region due to the large temporal variability in the sea ice cover including the overlying northward migration of the ice edge on decadal timescales, and thus, the resulting climate trends are not easy to interpret (Comiso, 2003). A combined surface temperature dataset of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone (MIZ)   provides a consistent climate indicator, which is important for studying climate trends in the Arctic region. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe basin-average trend of SST/IST anomalies for the Arctic Ocean region amounts to 0.122\u00b10.008 \u00b0C/year   over the period 1993-2022 which corresponds to an average warming of 3.66\u00b0C. Warming trends are highest for the Kara Sea and the Arctic Ocean region over Eurasia. The 2d map of Arctic anomalies reveals regional peak warmings exceeding 10\u00b0C.   \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of monthly mean (turquoise line) and annual mean (blue line) of sea and ice surface temperature anomalies for January 1993 to December 2022, relative to the 1993-2014 mean, for the Arctic SST/IST product (OMI_CLIMATE_SST_IST_ARCTIC_area_averaged_anomalies).

(2008) and further reported by Tranchant et al. (2019) in the CMEMS Ocean State Report #3. The NPGO is defined as the second dominant mode of variability of Sea Surface Height (SSH) anomaly and SST anomaly in the Northeast Pacific (25\u00b0\u2013 62\u00b0N, 180\u00b0\u2013 250\u00b0E). The spatial and temporal pattern of the NPGO has been deduced over the [1950-2004] period using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition on sea level and sea surface temperature fields produced by the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008; Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005). Afterward, the sea level spatial pattern of the NPGO is used/projected with satellite altimeter delayed-time sea level anomalies to calculate and update the NPGO index.\nThe NPGO index disseminated on CMEMS was specifically updated from 2004 onward using up-to-date altimeter products (DT2021 version; SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY _008_047 CMEMS product, including \u201cmy\u201d & \u201cmyint\u201d datasets, and the near-real time SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT _008_046 CMEMS product). Users that previously used the index disseminated on www.o3d.org/npgo/ web page will find slight differences induced by this update. The change in the reprocessed version (previously DT-2018) and the extension of the mean value of the SSH anomaly (now 27 years, previously 20 years) induce some slight changes not impacting the general variability of the NPGO.  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nNPGO mode emerges as the leading mode of decadal variability for surface salinity and upper ocean nutrients (Di Lorenzo et al., 2009). The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) term is used because its fluctuations reflect changes in the intensity of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyres circulations (Chhak et al., 2009). This index measures change in the North Pacific gyres circulation and explains key physical-biological ocean variables including temperature, salinity, sea level, nutrients, chlorophyll-a. A positive North Pacific Gyre Oscillation phase is a dipole pattern with negative SSH anomaly north of 40\u00b0N and the opposite south of 40\u00b0N. (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008) suggested that the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation is the oceanic expression of the atmospheric variability of the North Pacific Oscillation (Walker and Bliss, 1932), which has an expression in both the 2nd EOFs of SSH and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies (Ceballos et al., 2009). This finding is further supported by the recent work of (Yi et al., 2018) showing consistent pattern features between the atmospheric North Pacific Oscillation and the oceanic North Pacific Gyre Oscillation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) database.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe NPGO index is presently in a negative phase, associated with a positive SSH anomaly north of 40\u00b0N and negative south of 40\u00b0N. This reflects a reduced amplitude of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyre, corresponding to a reduced coastal upwelling and thus a lower sea surface salinity and concentration of nutrients. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nNorth Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index monthly averages. The NPGO index has been projected on normalized satellite altimeter sea level anomalies. The NPGO index is derived from (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008) before 2004, the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) completed by DUACS near Real Time (\u201cnrt\u201d) sea level multi-mission gridded products. The vertical red lines show the date of the transition between the historical Di Lorenzo\u2019s series and the DUACS product, then between the DUACS \u201cmyint\u201d and \u201cnrt\u201d products used.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00221\n\n**References:**\n\n* Ceballos, L.

It is computed for the variable sea surface temperature measured by in situ buoys at depths between 0 and 5 meters. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is one of the essential ocean variables affected by climate change (mean SST trends, SST spatial and interannual variability, and extreme events). In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe North-West Self area comprises part of the North Atlantic, where this refreshing trend has been observed, and the North Sea, where a warming trend has been taking place in the last three decades (e.g. H\u00f8yer and Karagali, 2016).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a range from 14\u00baC in the Northwest of the British Isles, 18\u00baC in the English Channel to 20-21\u00baC around Denmark (Helgoland Bight, Skagerrak and Kattegat Seas). The standard deviation ranges from 0.5\u00baC in the English Channel and 0.8in the Northwest of the British Isles to 1.0 in the buoys around Denmark, reaching 3\u00baC in Helgoland Bight.\nResults for this year show either positive (+1\u00baC) or negative (-0.1) anomalies around their corresponding standard deviation in all the area, except in Hornbaek station in the South of Kattegat Sea where the positive anomaly reaches +2.0\u00baC, over the 1.3\u00baC of standard deviation, in concordance with the positive anomalies found in the Zealand Region in the Baltic OMI.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00274\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

This reprocessed product consists of daily (nighttime) interpolated 0.05\u00b0 grid resolution SST maps built from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Merchant et al., 2019) and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) initiatives. Trend analysis has been performed by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (see e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005), which has the effect of filtering the input SST time series acting as a low bandpass filter for interannual variations. Mann-Kendall test and Sens\u2019s method (Sen 1968) were applied to assess whether there was a monotonic upward or downward trend and to estimate the slope of the trend and its 95% confidence interval. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the period 1993-2022, the Iberia-Biscay-Irish Seas mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) increased at a rate of 0.013 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b0C/Year.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nSea surface temperature trend over the period 1993-2022 in the Iberia-Biscay-Irish Seas.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe mean sea level evolution estimated in the Irish-Biscay-Iberian (IBI) region is derived from the average of the gridded sea level maps weighted by the cosine of the latitude. The annual and semi-annual periodic signals are removed (least square fit of sinusoidal function) and the time series is low-pass filtered (175 days cut-off). The curve is corrected for the regional mean effect of the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) using the ICE5G-VM2 GIA model (Peltier, 2004) to consider the ongoing movement of land due to post-glacial rebound.\nDuring 1993-1998, the Global men sea level (hereafter GMSL) has been known to be affected by a TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; Legeais et al., 2020). This drift led to overestimate the trend of the GMSL during the first 6 years of the altimetry record (about 0.04 mm/y at global scale over the whole altimeter period). A correction of the drift is proposed for the Global mean sea level (Legeais et al., 2020).   Whereas this TOPEX-A instrumental drift should also affect the regional mean sea level (hereafter RMSL) trend estimation, currently this empirical correction is currently not applied to the altimeter sea level dataset and resulting estimated for RMSL. Indeed, the pertinence of the global correction applied at regional scale has not been demonstrated yet and there is no clear consensus achieved on the way to proceed at regional scale. Additionally, the estimation of such a correction at regional scale is not obvious, especially in areas where few accurate independent measurements (e.g. in situ)- necessary for this estimation - are available. The trend uncertainty is provided in a 90% confidence interval (Prandi et al., 2021). This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation considering to the altimeter period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not taken into account.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018).. At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously, and RMSL rise can also be influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nIn IBI region, the RMSL trend is modulated by decadal variations. As observed over the global ocean, the main actors of the long-term RMSL trend are associated with anthropogenic global/regional warming. Decadal variability is mainly linked to the strengthening or weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (e.g. Chafik et al., 2019). The latest is driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016). Along the European coast, the NAO also influences the along-slope winds dynamic which in return significantly contributes to the local sea level variability observed (Chafik et al., 2019).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2022/08/04] period, the basin-wide RMSL in the IBI area rises at a rate of 3.9 \uf0b1 0.82 mm/year.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nRegional mean sea level daily evolution (in cm) over the  [1993/01/01, 2022/08/04] period, from the satellite altimeter observations estimated in the Irish-Biscay-Iberian region, derived from the average of the gridded sea level maps weighted by the cosine of the latitude. The ocean monitoring indicator is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) altimeter sea level gridded pr  oducts distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).

Regional uncertainties on the trends estimates can be found in Prandi et al., 2021.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers(WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). According to the IPCC 6th assessment report (IPCC WGI, 2021), global mean sea level (GMSL) increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901 to 2018 with a rate of rise that has accelerated since the 1960s to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm/yr for the period 2006\u20132018. Human activity was very likely the main driver of observed GMSL rise since 1970 (IPCC WGII, 2021). The weight of the different contributions evolves with time and in the recent decades the mass change has increased, contributing to the on-going acceleration of the GMSL trend (IPCC, 2022a; Legeais et al., 2020; Horwath et al., 2022). At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously, and regional sea level change is also influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2019, 2022b). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022c). \n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe altimeter sea level trends over the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period exhibit large-scale variations with trends up to +10 mm/yr in regions such as the western tropical Pacific Ocean. In this area, trends are mainly of thermosteric origin (Legeais et al., 2018; Meyssignac et al., 2017) in response to increased easterly winds during the last two decades associated with the decreasing Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)/Pacific Decadal Oscillation (e.g., McGregor et al., 2012; Merrifield et al., 2012; Palanisamy et al., 2015; Rietbroek et al., 2016).\nPrandi et al. (2021) have estimated a regional altimeter sea level error budget from which they determine a regional error variance-covariance matrix and they provide uncertainties of the regional sea level trends. Over 1993-2019, the averaged local sea level trend uncertainty is around 0.83 mm/yr with local values ranging from 0.78 to 1.22 mm/yr. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00238\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nature Clim Change, 4, 358\u2013361, https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2159, 2014.\n* Horwath, M., Gutknecht, B.

SSTfnd is defined within GHRSST as the temperature at the base of the diurnal thermocline. It is so named because it represents the foundation temperature on which the diurnal thermocline develops during the day. SSTfnd changes only gradually along with the upper layer of the ocean, and by definition it is independent of skin SST fluctuations due to wind- and radiation-dependent diurnal stratification or skin layer response. It is therefore updated at intervals of 24 hrs. SSTfnd corresponds to the temperature of the upper mixed layer which is the part of the ocean represented by the top-most layer of grid cells in most numerical ocean models. It is never observed directly by satellites, but it comes closest to being detected by infrared and microwave radiometers during the night, when the previous day's diurnal stratification can be assumed to have decayed.\n\nThe processing combines the observations of multiple polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, embedding infrared of microwave radiometers. All these sources are intercalibrated with each other before merging. A ranking procedure is used to select the best sensor observation for each grid point. An optimal interpolation is used to fill in where observations are missing.\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00321", "providers": [{"name": "Ifremer (France)", "roles": ["producer"]}, {"name": "Copernicus Marine Service", "roles": ["host", "processor"], "url": "https://marine.copernicus.eu"}], "doi": "10.48670/mds-00321"}, "OMI_CLIMATE_SST_BAL_area_averaged_anomalies": {"instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "baltic-sea,coastal-marine-environment,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,oceanographic-geographical-features,omi-climate-sst-bal-area-averaged-anomalies,satellite-observation,sea-surface-foundation-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": "proprietary", "title": "Baltic Sea Surface Temperature anomaly time series and trend from Observations Reprocessing", "missionStartDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "**DEFINITION**\n\nThe OMI_CLIMATE_SST_BAL_area_averaged_anomalies product includes time series of monthly mean SST anomalies over the period 1993-2022, relative to the 1993-2014 climatology, averaged for the Baltic Sea.

The Baltic Sea is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST records and the assessment of climatic variability (H\u00f8yer and She 2007; H\u00f8yer and Karagali 2016). The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed basin with natural variability and it is influenced by large-scale atmospheric processes and by the vicinity of land. In addition, the Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world. When analysing regional-scale climate variability, all these effects have to be considered, which requires dedicated regional and validated SST products. Satellite observations have previously been used to analyse the climatic SST signals in the North Sea and Baltic Sea (BACC II Author Team 2015; Lehmann et al. 2011). Recently, H\u00f8yer and Karagali (2016) demonstrated that the Baltic Sea had warmed 1-2 oC from 1982 to 2012 considering all months of the year and 3-5 oC when only July-September months were considered. This was corroborated in the Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe basin-average trend of SST anomalies for Baltic Sea region amounts to 0.048\u00b10.006\u00b0C/year over the period 1993-2022 which corresponds to an average warming of 1.44\u00b0C. Adding the North Sea area, the average trend amounts to 0.029\u00b10.003\u00b0C/year over the same period, which corresponds to an average warming of 0.87\u00b0C for the entire region since 1993. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of monthly mean (turquoise line) and annual mean (blue line) of sea surface temperature anomalies for January 1993 to December 2022, relative to the 1993-2014 mean, combined for the Baltic Sea and North Sea SST  (OMI_CLIMATE_SST_BAL_area_averaged_anomalies).

The IBI SST OMI is built from the CMEMS Reprocessed European North West Shelf Iberai-Biscay-Irish Seas  (SST_MED_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_026, see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-CLIMATE-SST-IBI_v2.1.pdf), which provided the SSTs used to compute the evolution of SST anomalies over the European North West Shelf Seas. This reprocessed product consists of daily (nighttime) interpolated 0.05\u00b0 grid resolution SST maps over the European North West Shelf Iberia-Biscay-Irish Seas built from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Merchant et al., 2019), Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) initiatives and Eumetsat data. Anomalies are computed against the 1993-2014 reference period.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe overall trend in the SST anomalies in this region is 0.013 \u00b10.001 \u00b0C/year over the period 1993-2022.    \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of monthly mean and 12-month filtered sea surface temperature anomalies in the Iberia-Biscay-Irish Seas during the period 1993-2022. Anomalies are relative to the climatological period 1993-2014 and built from the CMEMS SST_ATL_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_026 satellite product (see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-IBI-SST.pdf). The sea surface temperature trend with its 95% confidence interval (shown in the box) is estimated by using the X-11 seasonal adjustment procedure (e.g. Pezzulli et al., 2005) and Sen\u2019s method (Sen 1968).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00256\n\n**References:**\n\n* Deser, C., Alexander, M.

The observed decrease in ocean pH resulting from increasing concentrations of CO2 is an important indicator of global change. The estimate of global mean pH builds on a reconstruction methodology, \n* Obtain values for alkalinity based on the so called \u201clocally interpolated alkalinity regression (LIAR)\u201d method after Carter et al., 2016; 2018. \n* Build on surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CMEMS product: MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008) obtained from an ensemble of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (Chau et al. 2022) which exploit sampling data gathered in the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) (https://www.socat.info/)\n* Derive a gridded field of ocean surface pH based on the van Heuven et al., (2011) CO2 system calculations using reconstructed pCO2 (MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008) and alkalinity.\nThe global mean average of pH at yearly time steps is then calculated from the gridded ocean surface pH field. It is expressed in pH unit on total hydrogen ion scale. In the figure, the amplitude of the uncertainty (1\u03c3  ) of yearly mean surface sea water pH varies at a range of (0.0023, 0.0029) pH unit (see Quality Information Document for more details). The trend and uncertainty estimates amount to -0.0017\u00b10.0004e-1 pH units per year.\nThe indicator is derived from in situ observations of CO2 fugacity (SOCAT data base, www.socat.info, Bakker et al., 2016). These observations are still sparse in space and time.  Monitoring pH at higher space and time resolutions, as well as in coastal regions will require a denser network of observations and preferably direct pH measurements.  \nA full discussion regarding this OMI can be found in section 2.10 of the Ocean State Report 4 (Gehlen et al., 2020).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe decrease in surface ocean pH is a direct consequence of the uptake by the ocean of carbon dioxide. It is referred to as ocean acidification. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Workshop on Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Marine Biology and Ecosystems (2011) defined Ocean Acidification as \u201ca reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean\u201d. The pH of contemporary surface ocean waters is already 0.1 lower than at pre-industrial times and an additional decrease by 0.33 pH units is projected over the 21st century in response to the high concentration pathway RCP8.5 (Bopp et al., 2013). Ocean acidification will put marine ecosystems at risk (e.g. Orr et al., 2005; Gehlen et al., 2011; Kroeker et al., 2013). The monitoring of surface ocean pH has become a focus of many international scientific initiatives (http://goa-on.org/) and constitutes one target for SDG14 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg14).  \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince the year 1985, global ocean surface pH is decreasing at a rate of  -0.0017\u00b10.0004e-1 per year. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00224\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bakker, D. et al.: A multi-decade record of high-quality fCO2 data in version 3 of the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT), Earth Syst.

It is computed for the variable sea level measured by tide gauges along the coast. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The annual percentiles referred to annual mean sea level are temporally averaged and their spatial evolution is displayed in the dataset baltic_omi_sl_extreme_var_slev_mean_and_anomaly_obs, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\nSea level (SLEV) is one of the Essential Ocean Variables most affected by climate change. Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990\u2019s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one meter by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves.   \nThe Baltic Sea is affected by vertical land motion due to the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (Ludwigsen et al., 2020) and consequently relative sea level trends (as measured by tide gauges) have been shown to be strongly negative, especially in the northern part of the basin. On the other hand, Baltic Sea absolute sea level trends (from altimetry-based observations) show statistically significant positive trends (Passaro et al., 2021).  \n\n** KEY FINDINGS**\nUp to 44 stations fulfill the completeness index criteria in this region, a few less than in 2020 (51). The spatial variation of the mean 99th percentiles follow the tidal range pattern, reaching its highest values in the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia (e.g.: 0.81 m above mean sea level in Kemi) and the inner part of the Gulf of Finland (e.g.: 0.72 m above mean sea level in Hamina, Finland). Smaller tides and therefore 99th percentiles are found along the southeastern coast of Sweden, between Stockholm and Gotland Island (e.g.: 0.43 m above mean sea level in Landsort). Annual percentiles standard deviation ranges between 3-5 cm in the South (e.g.: 3 cm in Korsor, Denmark) to 10-13 cm in the Gulf of Finland (e.g.: 12 cm in Hamina).  Negative anomalies of 2021 99th percentile are observed for most of the basin, reaching maximum values in the Gulf of Bothnia (up to -17 cm in Oulu). Smaller negative anomalies are observed in the southern part (Danish coast), where the only station showing a positive anomaly is Gedser (4 cm).  This result is similar to the one observed in 2019 and contrasts with the remarkably positive anomalies in 2020 for all the stations. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00203\n\n**References:**\n\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.

It is computed for the variable sea surface temperature measured by in situ buoys at depths between 0 and 5 meters. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is one of the essential ocean variables affected by climate change (mean SST trends, SST spatial and interannual variability, and extreme events). In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Iberia Biscay Ireland area is characterized by a great complexity in terms of processes that take place in it. The sea surface temperature varies depending on the latitude with higher values to the South. In this area, the clear warming trend observed in other European Seas is not so evident. The northwest part is influenced by the refreshing trend in the North Atlantic, and a mild warming trend has been observed in the last decade (Pisano et al. 2020).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a range from 16-18\u00baC in the Southwest of the British Isles and English Channel, 19\u00baC in the West of Galician Coast, 21-23\u00baC in the south of Bay of Biscay, 23.5\u00baC in the Gulf of Cadiz to 24\u00baC in the Canary Island. The standard deviations are between 0.5\u00baC and 1.3\u00baC.\nResults for this year show a general positive anomaly in the South of the British Isles (+0.5/+1.7\u00baC), barely over the standard deviation. In the North of Spain, the anomaly is slightly negative between -0.3\u00baC and -0.9\u00baC, except in the North-West of the Iberian Peninsula where is slightly positive (+0.3/0.9\u00baC). In the Gulf of Cadiz and in Canary Island is close to zero. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00255\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nIn the North Atlantic, the mean wave height shows some weak trends not very statistically significant. Young & Ribal (2019) found a mostly positive weak trend in the European Coasts while Timmermans et al.  (2020) showed a weak negative trend in high latitudes, including the North Sea and even more intense in the Norwegian Sea. For extreme values, some authors have found a clearer positive trend in high percentiles (90th-99th) (Young, 2011; Young & Ribal, 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS** \n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a wide range from 2.5 meters in the English Channel with 0.3m of standard deviation (std), 3-5m in the southern and central North Sea with 0.3-0.5m of std, 4 meters in the Skagerrak Strait with 0.5m of std, 7.5m in the northern North Sea with 0.55m of std to 8 meters in the North of the British Isles with 0.6m of std. \nResults for this year show either low positive or negative anomalies, inside the margin of the standard deviation. Only the negative anomaly in in the Skagerrak Strait (Vaderoarna station) is a bit above this margin with a value of -0.62m. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00270\n\n**References:**\n\n* Goda Y. 2010.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the North-West Shelf Sea weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and regional mean GIA correction (weighted GIA mean of a 27 ensemble model following Spada et Melini, 2019). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.The trend uncertainty is provided in a 90% confidence interval. It is calculated as the weighted mean uncertainties in the region from Prandi et al., 2021. This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation depending on the period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nIn this region, the time series shows decadal variations. As observed over the global ocean, the main actors of the long-term sea level trend are associated with anthropogenic global/regional warming (IPCC WGII, 2021). Decadal variability is mainly linked to the Strengthening or weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (e.g. Chafik et al., 2019). The latest is driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for decadal (20-30y) timescales (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016). Along the European coast, the NAO also influences the along-slope winds dynamic which in return significantly contributes to the local sea level variability observed (Chafik et al., 2019). Hermans et al., 2020 also reported the dominant influence of wind on interannual sea level variability in a large part of this area. They also underscored the influence of the inverse barometer forcing in some coastal regions.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the NWS area rises at a rate of 3.2 \uf0b1 0.8 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.09 \uf0b1\uf0200.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nRegional mean sea level daily evolution (in cm) over the [1993/01/01, 2022/08/04] period, from the satellite altimeter observations estimated in the North-West Shelf region, derived from the average of the gridded sea level maps weighted by the cosine of the latitude. The ocean monitoring indicator is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) altimeter sea level gridded products distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057). The annual and semi-annual periodic signals are removed, the timeseries is low-pass filtered (175 days cut-off), and the curve is corrected for the GIA using the ICE5G-VM2 GIA model (Peltier, 2004).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00271\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

The Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) data in this collection is a radiometrically terrain corrected product derived from the [Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-1-grd) products produced by the European Space Agency. The RTC processing is performed by [Catalyst](https://catalyst.earth/).\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction accounts for terrain variations that affect both the position of a given point on the Earth's surface and the brightness of the radar return, as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover-induced backscatter differences. Additionally, comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning.\n\nA Planetary Computer account is required to retrieve SAS tokens to read the RTC data. See the [documentation](http://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/#when-an-account-is-needed) for more information.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe Sentinel-1 GRD product is converted to calibrated intensity using the conversion algorithm described in the ESA technical note ESA-EOPG-CSCOP-TN-0002, [Radiometric Calibration of S-1 Level-1 Products Generated by the S-1 IPF](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/S1-Radiometric-Calibration-V1.0.pdf). The flat earth calibration values for gamma correction (i.e. perpendicular to the radar line of sight) are extracted from the GRD metadata. The calibration coefficients are applied as a two-dimensional correction in range (by sample number) and azimuth (by time). All available polarizations are calibrated and written as separate layers of a single file. The calibrated SAR output is reprojected to nominal map orientation with north at the top and west to the left.\n\nThe data is then radiometrically terrain corrected using PlanetDEM as the elevation source. The correction algorithm is nominally based upon D. Small, [\u201cFlattening Gamma: Radiometric Terrain Correction for SAR Imagery\u201d](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/2011_Flattening_Gamma.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol 49, No 8., August 2011, pp 3081-3093. For each image scan line, the digital elevation model is interpolated to determine the elevation corresponding to the position associated with the known near slant range distance and arc length for each input pixel. The elevations at the four corners of each pixel are estimated using bilinear resampling. The four elevations are divided into two triangular facets and reprojected onto the plane perpendicular to the radar line of sight to provide an estimate of the area illuminated by the radar for each earth flattened pixel. The uncalibrated sum at each earth flattened pixel is normalized by dividing by the flat earth surface area. The adjustment for gamma intensity is given by dividing the normalized result by the cosine of the incident angle. Pixels which are not illuminated by the radar due to the viewing geometry are flagged as shadow.\n\nCalibrated data is then orthorectified to the appropriate UTM projection. The orthorectified output maintains the original sample sizes (in range and azimuth) and was not shifted to any specific grid.\n\nRTC data is processed only for the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which is the main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements.\n", "instrument": null, "platform": "Sentinel-1", "platformSerialIdentifier": "SENTINEL-1A,SENTINEL-1B", "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "c-band,copernicus,esa,rtc,sar,sentinel,sentinel-1,sentinel-1-rtc,sentinel-1a,sentinel-1b", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "title": "Sentinel 1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC)", "missionStartDate": "2014-10-10T00:28:21Z"}, "gridmet": {"abstract": "gridMET is a dataset of daily surface meteorological data at approximately four-kilometer resolution, covering the contiguous U.S. from 1979 to the present.

The operational GOES-R Satellites, GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18, capture 16-band imagery from geostationary orbits over the Western Hemisphere via the Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) radiometer. The ABI captures 2 visible, 4 near-infrared, and 10 infrared channels at resolutions between 0.5km and 2km.\n\n### Geographic coverage\n\nThe ABI captures three levels of coverage, each at a different temporal cadence depending on the modes described below. The geographic coverage for each image is described by the `goes:image-type` STAC Item property.\n\n- _FULL DISK_: a circular image depicting nearly full coverage of the Western Hemisphere.\n- _CONUS_: a 3,000 (lat) by 5,000 (lon) km rectangular image depicting the Continental U.S. (GOES-16) or the Pacific Ocean including Hawaii (GOES-17).\n- _MESOSCALE_: a 1,000 by 1,000 km rectangular image. GOES-16 and 17 both alternate between two different mesoscale geographic regions.\n\n### Modes\n\nThere are three standard scanning modes for the ABI instrument: Mode 3, Mode 4, and Mode 6.\n\n- Mode _3_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, three observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and thirty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every fifteen minutes.\n- Mode _4_ consists of the observation of the full disk scene every five minutes.\n- Mode _6_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, two observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and twenty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every ten minutes.\n\nThe mode that each image was captured with is described by the `goes:mode` STAC Item property.\n\nSee this [ABI Scan Mode Demonstration](https://youtu.be/_c5H6R-M0s8) video for an idea of how the ABI scans multiple geographic regions over time.\n\n### Cloud and Moisture Imagery\n\nThe Cloud and Moisture Imagery product contains one or more images with pixel values identifying \"brightness values\" that are scaled to support visual analysis.  Cloud and Moisture Imagery product (CMIP) files are generated for each of the sixteen ABI reflective and emissive bands. In addition, there is a multi-band product file that includes the imagery at all bands (MCMIP).\n\nThe Planetary Computer STAC Collection `goes-cmi` captures both the CMIP and MCMIP product files into individual STAC Items for each observation from a GOES-R satellite. It contains the original CMIP and MCMIP NetCDF files, as well as cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) exports of the data from each MCMIP band (2km); the full-resolution CMIP band for bands 1, 2, 3, and 5; and a Web Mercator COG of bands 1, 2 and 3, which are useful for rendering.\n\nThis product is not in a standard coordinate reference system (CRS), which can cause issues with some tooling that does not handle non-standard large geographic regions.\n\n### For more information\n- [Beginner\u2019s Guide to GOES-R Series Data](https://www.goes-r.gov/downloads/resources/documents/Beginners_Guide_to_GOES-R_Series_Data.pdf)\n- [GOES-R Series Product Definition and Users\u2019 Guide: Volume 5 (Level 2A+ Products)](https://www.goes-r.gov/products/docs/PUG-L2+-vol5.pdf) ([Spanish verison](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/raw/main/GOES/QuickGuides/Spanish/Guia%20introductoria%20para%20datos%20de%20la%20serie%20GOES-R%20V1.1%20FINAL2%20-%20Copy.pdf))\n\n", "instrument": "ABI", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": "GOES-16,GOES-17,GOES-18", "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "abi,cloud,goes,goes-16,goes-17,goes-18,goes-cmi,moisture,nasa,noaa,satellite", "license": "proprietary", "title": "GOES-R Cloud & Moisture Imagery", "missionStartDate": "2017-02-28T00:16:52Z"}, "terraclimate": {"abstract": "[TerraClimate](http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html) is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958 to the present.

ERA5 is produced by the\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a\nglobally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This\nprinciple, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical\nweather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a\nprevious forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal\nway to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called\nanalysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works\nin the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a\ndataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint\nof issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and\nwhen going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions\nof the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis\nproduct.\n\nThis dataset was converted to Zarr by [Planet OS](https://planetos.com/).\nSee [their documentation](https://github.com/planet-os/notebooks/blob/master/aws/era5-pds.md)\nfor more.\n\n## STAC Metadata\n\nTwo types of data variables are provided: \"forecast\" (`fc`) and \"analysis\" (`an`).\n\n* An **analysis**, of the atmospheric conditions, is a blend of observations\n  with a previous forecast.

A forecast\n  can provide\n  [instantaneous](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Model+grid+box+and+time+step)\n  parameters, accumulated parameters, mean rates, and min/max parameters.\n\nEach [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) item in this collection covers a single month\nand the entire globe.

The water level at the coastline is extended landwards to all areas that are hydrodynamically connected to the coast following a \u2018bathtub\u2019 like approach and calculates the flood depth as the difference between the water level and the topography. Unlike a simple 'bathtub' model, this model attenuates the water level over land with a maximum attenuation factor of 0.5\u2009m\u2009km-1. The attenuation factor simulates the dampening of the flood levels due to the roughness over land.\n\nIn its current version, the model does not account for varying roughness over land and permanent water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and it does not account for the compound effects of waves, rainfall, and river discharge on coastal flooding.

Users should consult the [ECMWF Forecast User Guide](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/1+Introduction) for detailed information on each of the products.\n\n## Overview of products\n\nThe following diagram shows the publishing schedule of the various products.\n\n<a href=\"https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png\"><img src=\"https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a>\n\nThe vertical axis shows the various products, defined below, which are grouped by combinations of `stream`, `forecast type`, and `reference time`. The horizontal axis shows *forecast times* in 3-hour intervals out from the reference time. A black square over a particular forecast time, or step, indicates that a forecast is made for that forecast time, for that particular `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time` combination.\n\n* **stream** is the forecasting system that produced the data. The values are available in the `ecmwf:stream` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `enfo`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), atmospheric fields\n  * `mmsf`: [multi-model seasonal forecasts](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast) fields from the ECMWF model only.\n  * `oper`: [high-resolution forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast), atmospheric fields \n  * `scda`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, atmospheric fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\")\n  * `scwv`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, ocean wave fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\") and\n  * `waef`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), ocean wave fields,\n  * `wave`: wave model\n* **type** is the forecast type. The values are available in the `ecmwf:type` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `fc`: forecast\n  * `ef`: ensemble forecast\n  * `pf`: ensemble probabilities\n  * `tf`: trajectory forecast for tropical cyclone tracks\n* **reference time** is the hours after midnight when the model was run. Each stream / type will produce assets for different forecast times (steps from the reference datetime) depending on the reference time.\n\nVisit the [ECMWF's User Guide](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time) for more details on each of the various products.\n\nAssets are available for the previous 30 days.\n\n## Asset overview\n\nThe data are provided as [GRIB2 files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+GRIB+files+and+how+can+I+read+them).\nAdditionally, [index files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time#ECMWFOpenDataRealTime-IndexFilesIndexfiles) are provided, which can be used to read subsets of the data from Azure Blob Storage.\n\nWithin each `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time`, the structure of the data are mostly consistent. Each GRIB2 file will have the\nsame data variables, coordinates (aside from `time` as the *reference time* changes and `step` as the *forecast time* changes). The exception\nis the `enfo-ep` and `waef-ep` products, which have more `step`s in the 240-hour forecast than in the 360-hour forecast. \n\nSee the example notebook for more on how to access the data.\n\n## STAC metadata\n\nThe Planetary Computer provides a single STAC item per GRIB2 file. Each GRIB2 file is global in extent, so every item has the same\n`bbox` and `geometry`.\n\nA few custom properties are available on each STAC item, which can be used in searches to narrow down the data to items of interest:\n\n* `ecmwf:stream`: The forecasting system (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:type`: The forecast type (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:step`: The offset from the reference datetime, expressed as `<value><unit>`, for example `\"3h\"` means \"3 hours from the reference datetime\". \n* `ecmwf:reference_datetime`: The datetime when the model was run. This indicates when the forecast *was made*, rather than when it's valid for.\n* `ecmwf:forecast_datetime`: The datetime for which the forecast is valid. This is also set as the item's `datetime`.\n\nSee the example notebook for more on how to use the STAC metadata to query for particular data.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe products listed and described on this page are available to the public and their use is governed by the [Creative Commons CC-4.0-BY license and the ECMWF Terms of Use](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/).

The CDL is a crop-specific land cover classification product of more than 100 crop categories grown in the United States. CDLs are derived using a supervised land cover classification of satellite imagery. The supervised classification relies on first manually identifying pixels within certain images, often called training sites, which represent the same crop or land cover type. Using these training sites, a spectral signature is developed for each crop type that is then used by the analysis software to identify all other pixels in the satellite image representing the same crop. Using this method, a new CDL is compiled annually and released to the public a few months after the end of the growing season.\n\nThis collection includes Cropland, Confidence, Cultivated, and Frequency products.\n\n- Cropland: Crop-specific land cover data created annually. There are currently four individual crop frequency data layers that represent four major crops: corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat.\n- Confidence: The predicted confidence associated with an output pixel. A value of zero indicates low confidence, while a value of 100 indicates high confidence.\n- Cultivated: cultivated and non-cultivated land cover for CONUS based on land cover information derived from the 2017 through 2021 Cropland products.\n- Frequency: crop specific planting frequency based on land cover information derived from the 2008 through 2021 Cropland products.\n\nFor more, visit the [Cropland Data Layer homepage](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php).", "instrument": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "keywords": "agriculture,land-cover,land-use,united-states,usda,usda-cdl", "license": "proprietary", "title": "USDA Cropland Data Layers (CDLs)", "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z"}, "eclipse": {"abstract": "The [Project Eclipse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-eclipse/) Network is a low-cost air quality sensing network for cities and a research project led by the [Urban Innovation Group]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/urban-innovation-research/) at Microsoft Research.\n\nProject Eclipse currently includes over 100 locations in Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n\nThis network was deployed starting in July, 2021, through a collaboration with the City of Chicago, the Array of Things Project, JCDecaux Chicago, and the Environmental Law and Policy Center as well as local environmental justice organizations in the city.

The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 179MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-SA-40]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax` for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations in the above table include all three variables.\n\n[^2]: The institution which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

Yet, these maps are often years out of date by the time they are available to scientists and policy-makers. The datasets in this STAC Collection build on past studies that map Biodiversity Intactness using the [PREDICTS database](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2579) of spatially referenced observations of biodiversity across 32,000 sites from over 750 studies. The approach differs from previous work by modeling the relationship between observed biodiversity metrics and contemporary, global, geospatial layers of human pressures, with the intention of providing a high resolution monitoring product into the future.\n\nBiodiversity intactness is estimated as a combination of two metrics: Abundance, the quantity of individuals, and Compositional Similarity, how similar the composition of species is to an intact baseline. Linear mixed effects models are fit to estimate the predictive capacity of spatial datasets of human pressures on each of these metrics and project results spatially across the globe.

Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available.

For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived.

In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org) provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`) corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\n\n## Accessing the data\n\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available.

Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but was relicensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) in March, 2023. \n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

This processing date is part of the URL for each parquet file and is captured in the STAC metadata\nfor each item (see below).\n\n## Delta Format\n\nThe collection-level asset under the `delta` key gives you the fsspec-style URL\nto the Delta table. This can be used to efficiently query for matching partitions\nby `Region` and `quadkey`. See the notebook for an example using Python.\n\n## STAC metadata\n\nThis STAC collection has one STAC item per region. The `msbuildings:region`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific region, and the `msbuildings:quadkey`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific quadkey (though you can also search\nby the `geometry`).\n\nNote that older STAC items are not spatially partitioned.
