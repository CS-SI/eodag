These values are cumulated in the entire Southern Hemisphere (excluding ice lakes) and from 1993 up to real time aiming to:\ni) obtain the Antarctic sea ice extent as expressed in millions of km squared (106 km2) to monitor both the large-scale variability and mean state and change.\nii) to monitor the change in sea ice extent as expressed in millions of km squared per decade (106 km2/decade), or in sea ice extent loss/gain since the beginning of the time series as expressed in percent per decade (%/decade; reference period being the first date of the key figure b) dot-dashed trend line, Vaughan et al., 2013)). For the Southern Hemisphere, these trends are calculated from the annual mean values.\nThe Antarctic sea ice extent used here is based on the \u201cmulti-product\u201d (GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ENS_001_031) approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (CMEMS OSR, 2017). Five global products have been used to build the ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of the sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and how much the sea ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth as sea ice is one of the highest sensitive natural environments. Variations in sea ice cover can induce changes in ocean stratification and modify the key rule played by the cold poles in the Earth engine (IPCC, 2019).  \nThe sea ice cover is monitored here in terms of sea ice extent quantity. More details and full scientific evaluations can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State Report (Samuelsen et al., 2016; Samuelsen et al., 2018).\n \n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWith quasi regular highs and lows, the annual Antarctic sea ice extent shows large variability until several monthly record high in 2014 and record lows in 2017, 2018 and 2023. Since the year 1993, the Southern Hemisphere annual sea ice extent regularly alternates positive and negative trend. The period 1993-2023 have seen a slight decrease at a rate of -0.28*106km2 per decade. This represents a loss amount of -2.4% per decade of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent during this period; with however large uncertainties. The last quarter of the year 2016 and years 2017 and 2018 experienced unusual losses of ice. The year 2023 is an exceptional year and its average has a strong impact on the whole time series.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00186\n\n**References:**\n\n* IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

SIC is the fractional area of ocean surface that is covered with sea ice. SIC is computed from Passive Microwave satellite observations since 1979. \nSIE is often reported with units of 106 km2 (millions square kilometers). The change in sea ice extent (trend) is expressed in millions of km squared per decade (106 km2/decade). In addition, trends are expressed relative to the 1979-2022 period in % per decade.\nThese trends are calculated (i) from the annual mean values; (ii) from the September values (winter ice loss); (iii) from February values (summer ice loss). The annual mean trend is reported on the key figure, the September (maximum extent) and February (minimum extent) values are reported in the text below.\nSIE includes all sea ice, except for lake and river ice.\nSee also section 1.7 in Samuelsen et al. (2016) for an introduction to this Ocean Monitoring Indicator (OMI).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats at the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and by how much the sea-ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth (Meredith et al. 2019). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince 1979, there has been an overall slight increase of sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere but a sharp decrease was observed after 2016. Over the period 1979-2022, the annual rate amounts to +0.02 +/- 0.05 106 km2 per decade (+0.18% per decade). Winter (September) sea ice extent trend amounts to +0.06 +/- 0.05106 km2 per decade (+0.32% per decade). Summer (February) sea ice extent trend amounts to -0.01+/- 0.05 106 km2 per decade (-0.38% per decade). These trend estimates are hardly significant, which is in agreement with the IPCC SROCC, which has assessed that \u2018Antarctic sea ice extent overall has had no statistically significant trend (1979\u20132018) due to contrasting regional signals and large interannual variability (high confidence).\u2019 (IPCC, 2019). Both June and July 2022 had the lowest average sea ice extent values for these months since 1979. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\na) The seasonal cycle of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2 averaged over the period 1979-2022 (red), shown together with the seasonal cycle in the year 2022 (green), and b) time series of yearly average Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent expressed in millions of km2. Time series are based on satellite observations (SMMR, SSM/I, SSMIS) by EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index (v2.2) with R&D input from ESA CCI.

For further details, see Lien et al. (2021).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Arctic Ocean contains a large amount of freshwater, and the freshwater export from the Arctic to the North Atlantic influence the stratification, and, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Aagaard et al., 1985). The Fram Strait represents the major gateway for freshwater transport from the Arctic Ocean, both as liquid freshwater and as sea ice (e.g., Vinje et al., 1998). The transport of sea ice through the Fram Strait is therefore important for the mass balance of the perennial sea-ice cover in the Arctic as it represents a large export of about 10% of the total sea ice volume every year (e.g., Rampal et al., 2011). Sea ice export through the Fram Strait has been found to explain a major part of the interannual variations in Arctic perennial sea ice volume changes (Ricker et al., 2018). The sea ice and associated freshwater transport to the Barents Sea has been suggested to be a driving mechanism for the presence of Arctic Water in the northern Barents Sea, and, hence, the presence of the Barents Sea Polar Front dividing the Barents Sea into a boreal and an Arctic part (Lind et al., 2018). In recent decades, the Arctic part of the Barents Sea has been giving way to an increasing boreal part, with large implications for the marine ecosystem and harvestable resources (e.g., Fossheim et al., 2015).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe sea-ice transport through the Fram Strait shows a distinct seasonal cycle in both sea ice area and volume transport, with a maximum in winter. There is a slight positive trend in the volume transport over the last two and a half decades. In the Barents Sea, a strong reduction of nearly 90% in average sea-ice thickness has diminished the sea-ice import from the Polar Basin (Lien et al., 2021). In both areas, the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea, the winds governed by the regional patterns of atmospheric pressure is an important driving force of temporal variations in sea-ice transport (e.g., Aaboe et al., 2021; Lien et al., 2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00192\n\n**References:**\n\n* Aaboe S, Lind S, Hendricks S, Down E, Lavergne T, Ricker R. 2021.

These values are cumulated in the entire Northern Hemisphere (excluding ice lakes) and from 1993 up to the year 2019 aiming to:\ni) obtain the Arctic sea ice extent as expressed in millions of km square (106 km2) to monitor both the large-scale variability and mean state and change.\nii) to monitor the change in sea ice extent as expressed in millions of km squared per decade (106 km2/decade), or in sea ice extent loss since the beginning of the time series as expressed in percent per decade (%/decade; reference period being the first date of the key figure b) dot-dashed trend line, Vaughan et al., 2013). These trends are calculated in three ways, i.e. (i) from the annual mean values; (ii) from the March values (winter ice loss); (iii) from September values (summer ice loss).\nThe Arctic sea ice extent used here is based on the \u201cmulti-product\u201d  (GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ENS_001_031) approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (CMEMS OSR, 2017). Five global products have been used to build the ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. This large blanket of millions of square kilometers insulates the relatively warm ocean waters from the cold polar atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of the sea ice, forming and melting with the polar seasons, impacts both human activities and biological habitat. Knowing how and how much the sea ice cover is changing is essential for monitoring the health of the Earth as sea ice is one of the highest sensitive natural environments. Variations in sea ice cover can induce changes in ocean stratification, in global and regional sea level rates and modify the key rule played by the cold poles in the Earth engine (IPCC, 2019).  \nThe sea ice cover is monitored here in terms of sea ice extent quantity. More details and full scientific evaluations can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State Report (Samuelsen et al., 2016; Samuelsen et al., 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince the year 1993 to 2023 the Arctic sea ice extent has decreased significantly at an annual rate of -0.57*106 km2 per decade. This represents an amount of -4.8 % per decade of Arctic sea ice extent loss over the period 1993 to 2023. Over the period 1993 to 2018, summer (September) sea ice extent loss amounts to -1.18*106 km2/decade (September values), which corresponds to -14.85% per decade. Winter (March) sea ice extent loss amounts to -0.57*106 km2/decade, which corresponds to -3.42% per decade. These values slightly exceed the estimates given in the AR5 IPCC assessment report (estimate up to the year 2012) as a consequence of continuing Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent loss. Main change in the mean seasonal cycle is characterized by less and less presence of sea ice during summertime with time.  \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00190\n\n**References:**\n\n* IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

The volume has been calculated taking into account the three most important influencing abiotic factors of cod reproductive success: salinity > 11 g/kg, oxygen concentration\u2009>\u20092 ml/l and water temperature over 1.5\u00b0C (MacKenzie et al., 1996; Heikinheimo, 2008; Plikshs et al., 2015). The daily volumes are calculated as the volumes of the water with salinity > 11 g/kg, oxygen content\u2009>\u20092 ml/l and water temperature over 1.5\u00b0C in the Baltic Sea International Council for the Exploration of the Sea subdivisions of 25-28 (ICES, 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nCod (Gadus morhua) is a characteristic fish species in the Baltic Sea with major economic importance. Spawning stock biomasses of the Baltic cod have gone through a steep decline in the late 1980s (Bryhn et al., 2022). Water salinity and oxygen concentration affect cod stock through the survival of eggs (Westin and Nissling, 1991; Wieland et al., 1994). Major Baltic Inflows provide a suitable environment for cod reproduction by bringing saline oxygenated water to the deep basins of the Baltic Sea (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm and BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland). Increased cod reproductive volume has a positive effect on cod reproduction success, which should reflect an increase of stock size indicator 4\u20135 years after the Major Baltic Inflow (Raudsepp et al., 2019). Eastern Baltic cod reaches maturity around age 2\u20133, depending on the population density and environmental conditions. Low oxygen and salinity cause stress, which negatively affects cod recruitment, whereas sufficient conditions may bring about male cod maturation even at the age of 1.5 years (Cardinale and Modin, 1999; Karasiova et al., 2008). There are a number of environmental factors affecting cod populations (Bryhn et al., 2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nTypically, the cod reproductive volume in the Baltic Sea oscillates between 200 and 400 km\u00b3. There have been two distinct periods of significant increase, with maximum values reaching over 1200 km\u00b3, corresponding to the aftermath of Major Baltic Inflows (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm and BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland) from 2003 to 2004 and from 2016 to 2017. Following a decline to the baseline of 200 km\u00b3 in 2018, there was a rise to 800 km\u00b3 in 2019. The cod reproductive volume hit a second peak of 800 km\u00b3 in 2022 and has since stabilized at 600 km\u00b3. However, Bryhn et al. (2022) report no observed increase in the spawning stock biomass of the eastern Baltic Sea cod.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00196\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cardinale, M., Modin, J., 1999.

The total heat content is determined using the following formula:\n\nHC =  \u03c1 * cp * ( Tp  +273.15).\n\nHere, \u03c1 and cp represent spatially varying sea water density and specific heat, respectively, which are computed based on potential temperature, salinity and pressure using the UNESCO 1983 polynomial developed by Fofonoff and Millard (1983). The vertical integral is computed using the static cell vertical thicknesses sourced from the reanalysis product BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011 dataset cmems_mod_bal_phy_my_static, spanning from the sea surface to the 300 m depth. Spatial averaging is performed over the Baltic Sea spatial domain, defined as the region between 13\u00b0 - 31\u00b0 E and 53\u00b0 - 66\u00b0 N. To obtain the OHC annual anomaly time series in (J/m2), the mean heat content over the reference period of 1993-2014 was subtracted from the annual mean total heat content.\nWe evaluate the uncertainty from the mean annual error of the potential temperature compared to the observations from the Baltic Sea (Giorgetti et al., 2020). The shade corresponds to the RMSD of the annual mean heat content biases (\u00b1 35.3 MJ/m\u00b2) evaluated from the observed temperatures and corresponding model values. \nLinear trend (W/m2) has been estimated from the annual anomalies with the uncertainty of 1.96-times standard error.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOcean heat content is a key ocean climate change indicator. It accounts for the energy absorbed and stored by oceans. Ocean Heat Content in the upper 2,000 m of the World Ocean has increased with the rate of 0.35 \u00b1 0.08 W/m2 in the period 1955\u20132019, while during the last decade of 2010\u20132019 the warming rate was 0.70 \u00b1 0.07 W/m2 (Garcia-Soto et al., 2021). The high variability in the local climate of the Baltic Sea region is attributed to the interplay between a temperate marine zone and a subarctic continental zone. Therefore, the Ocean Heat Content of the Baltic Sea could exhibit strong interannual variability and the trend could be less pronounced than in the ocean.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe ocean heat content (OHC) of the Baltic Sea exhibits an increasing trend of 0.3\u00b10.1 W/m\u00b2, along with multi-year oscillations. This increase is less pronounced than the global OHC trend (Holland et al. 2019; von Schuckmann et al. 2019) and that of some other marginal seas (von Schuckmann et al. 2018; Lima et al. 2020). The relatively low trend values are attributed to the Baltic Sea's shallowness, which constrains heat accumulation in its waters. The most significant OHC anomaly was recorded in 2020, and following a decline from this peak, the anomaly has now stabilized at approximately 250 MJ/m\u00b2.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00322\n\n**References:**\n\n* Garcia-Soto C, Cheng L, Caesar L, Schmidtko S, Jewett EB, Cheripka A, Rigor I, Caballero A, Chiba S, B\u00e1ez JC, Zielinski T and Abraham JP (2021) An Overview of Ocean Climate Change Indicators: Sea Surface Temperature, Ocean Heat Content, Ocean pH, Dissolved Oxygen Concentration, Arctic Sea Ice Extent, Thickness and Volume, Sea Level and Strength of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation).

Sea ice concentration is the fractional coverage of an ocean area covered with sea ice. Daily sea ice extent values are computed from the daily sea ice concentration maps. All sea ice covering the Baltic Sea is included, except for lake ice. The data used to produce the charts are Synthetic Aperture Radar images as well as in situ observations from ice breakers (Uiboupin et al., 2010). The annual course of the sea ice extent has been calculated as daily mean ice extent for each day-of-year over the period October 1992 \u2013 September 2014. Weekly smoothed time series of the sea ice extent have been calculated from daily values using a 7-day moving average filter.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea ice coverage has a vital role in the annual course of physical and ecological conditions in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it is an important parameter for safe winter navigation. The presence of sea ice cover sets special requirements for navigation, both for the construction of the ships and their behavior in ice, as in many cases, merchant ships need icebreaker assistance. Temporal trends of the sea ice extent could be a valuable indicator of the climate change signal in the Baltic Sea region. It has been estimated that a 1 \u00b0C increase in the average air temperature results in the retreat of ice-covered area in the Baltic Sea about 45,000 km2 (Granskog et al., 2006). Decrease in maximum ice extent may influence vertical stratification of the Baltic Sea (Hordoir and Meier, 2012) and affect the onset of the spring bloom (Eilola et al., 2013). In addition, statistical sea ice coverage information is crucial for planning of coastal and offshore construction. Therefore, the knowledge about ice conditions and their variability is required and monitored in Copernicus Marine Service.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSea ice in the Baltic Sea exhibits a strong seasonal pattern. Typically, formation begins in October and can persist until June. The 2022/23 ice season saw a relatively low maximum ice extent in the Baltic Sea, peaking at around 65,000 km\u00b2. Formation started in November and accelerated in the second week of December. The ice extent then remained fairly stable and below the climatological average until the end of January. From February to the second week of March, the extent of sea ice steadily grew to its maximum of 65,000 km\u00b2, before gradually receding. The peak day for sea ice extent varies annually but generally oscillates between the end of February and the start of March (Singh et al., 2024). The past 30 years saw the highest sea ice extent at 260,000 km\u00b2 in 2010/11. Despite a downward trend in sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea from 1993 to 2022, the linear trend does not show statistical significance.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00200\n\n**References:**\n\n* Eilola K, M\u00e5rtensson S, Meier HEM, 2013.

Daily sea ice volume values are computed from the daily sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness maps.

Knowledge of the sea ice volume facilitates planning of icebreaking activity and operation of the icebreakers (Valdez Banda et al., 2015; Bostr\u00f6m and \u00d6sterman, 2017). A long-term monitoring of ice parameters is required for design and installation of offshore constructions in seasonally ice covered seas (Heinonen and Rissanen, 2017). A reduction of the sea ice volume in the Baltic Sea has a critical impact on the population of ringed seals (Harkonen et al., 2008). Ringed seals need stable ice conditions for about two months for breeding and moulting (Sundqvist et al., 2012). The sea ice is a habitat for diverse biological assemblages (Enberg et al., 2018).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the Baltic Sea, the ice season may begin in October and last until June. The maximum sea ice volume typically peaks in March, but in 2023, it was observed in April. The 2022/23 ice season saw a low maximum sea ice volume of approximately 14 km\u00b3. From 1993 to 2023, the annual maximum ice volume ranged from 4 km\u00b3 in 2020 to 60 km\u00b3 in 1996. There is a statistically significant downward trend of -0.73 km\u00b3/year (p=0.01) in the Baltic Sea's maximum sea ice volume. Recent trends indicate a decrease in sea ice fraction and thickness across the Baltic Sea, particularly in the Bothnian Bay, as reported by Singh et al.

The surface salinity varies horizontally from ~10 near the Danish Straits down to ~2 at the northernmost and easternmost sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The halocline, a vertical layer with rapid changes of salinity with depth that separates the well-mixed surface layer from the weakly stratified layer below, is located at the depth range of 60-80 metres (Matth\u00e4us, 1984). The bottom layer salinity below the halocline depth varies from 15 in the south down to 3 in the northern Baltic Sea (V\u00e4li et al., 2013). The long-term salinity is determined by net precipitation and river discharge as well as saline water inflows from the North Sea (Lehmann et al., 2022). Long-term salinity decrease may reduce the occurrence and biomass of the Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica association/symbiotic aggregations (Kotta et al., 2019). Changes in salinity and oxygen content affect the survival of the Baltic cod eggs (Raudsepp et al, 2019; von Dewitz et al., 2018).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe subsurface salinity from 1993 to 2023 exhibits distinct variations at different depths. In the surface layer up to 25 meters, which aligns with the average upper mixed layer depth in the Baltic Sea, there is no discernible trend. The salinity trend increases steadily from zero at a 25-meter depth to 0.04 per year at 70 meters. The most pronounced trend, 0.045 per year, is found within the extended halocline layer ranging from 70 to 150 meters. It is noteworthy that there is a slight reduction in the salinity trend to 0.04 per year between depths of 150 and 220 meters. Although this decrease is minor, it suggests that salt transport into the extended halocline layer is more pronounced than into the deeper layers. The Major Baltic Inflows are responsible for the significant salinity trend of 0.05 per year observed in the deepest layer of the Baltic Sea.   \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00207\n\n**References:**\n\n* von Dewitz B, Tamm S, Ho\u00c8flich K, Voss R, Hinrichsen H-H., 2018.

The temperature trend has been obtained through a linear fit for each time series of horizontally averaged annual temperature and at each depth level. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea in North-Eastern Europe. The temperature of the upper mixed layer of the Baltic Sea is characterised by a strong seasonal cycle driven by the annual course of solar radiation (Lepp\u00e4ranta and Myrberg, 2008). The maximum water temperatures in the upper layer are reached in July and August and the minimum during February, when the Baltic Sea becomes partially frozen (CMEMS OMI Baltic Sea Sea Ice Extent, CMEMS OMI Baltic Sea Sea Ice Volume). Seasonal thermocline, developing in the depth range of 10-30 m in spring, reaches its maximum strength in summer and is eroded in autumn. During autumn and winter the Baltic Sea is thermally mixed down to the permanent halocline in the depth range of 60-80 metres (Matth\u00e4us, 1984). The 20\u201350\u202fm thick cold intermediate layer forms below the upper mixed layer in March and is observed until October within the 15-65 m depth range (Chubarenko and Stepanova, 2018; Liblik and Lips, 2011). The deep layers of the Baltic Sea are disconnected from the ventilated upper ocean layers, and temperature variations are predominantly driven by mixing processes and horizontal advection. A warming trend of the sea surface waters is positively correlated with the increasing trend of diffuse attenuation of light (Kd490) and satellite-detected chlorophyll concentration (Kahru et al., 2016). Temperature increase in the water column could accelerate oxygen consumption during organic matter oxidation (Savchuk, 2018).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nAnalysis of subsurface temperatures from 1993 to 2023 indicates that the Baltic Sea is experiencing warming across all depth intervals. The temperature trend in the upper mixed layer (0-25 m) is approximately 0.055 \u00b0C/year, decreasing to 0.045 \u00b0C/year within the seasonal thermocline layer. A peak temperature trend of 0.065 \u00b0C/year is observed at a depth of 70 m, aligning with the base of the cold intermediate layer. Beyond this depth, the trend stabilizes, closely matching the 0.065 \u00b0C/year value. At a 95% confidence level, it can be stated that the Baltic Sea's warming is consistent with depth, averaging around 0.06 \u00b0C/year. Notably, recent trends show a significant increase; for instance, Savchuk's 2018 measurements indicate an average temperature trend of 0.04 \u00b0C/year in the Baltic Proper's deep layers (>60m) from 1979 to 2016.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00208\n\n**References:**\n\n* Chubarenko, I., Stepanova, N. 2018.

The Major Baltic Inflows occur seldom, sometimes many years apart (Mohrholz, 2018). The Major Baltic Inflow OMI consists of the time series of the bottom layer salinity in the Arkona basin and in the Bornholm basin and the time-depth plot of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the Gotland basin (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_sto2tz_gotland). Bottom salinity increase in the Arkona basin is the first indication of the saline water inflow, but not necessarily Major Baltic Inflow. Abrupt increase of bottom salinity of 2-3 units in the more downstream Bornholm basin is a solid indicator that Major Baltic Inflow has occurred.\nThe subsurface temperature trends have been derived from regional reanalysis results for the Baltic \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a huge brackish water basin in Northern Europe whose salinity is controlled by its freshwater budget and by the water exchange with the North Sea (e.g. Neumann et al., 2017). The saline and oxygenated water inflows to the Baltic Sea through the Danish straits, especially the Major Baltic Inflows, occur only intermittently (e.g. Mohrholz, 2018). Long-lasting periods of oxygen depletion in the deep layers of the central Baltic Sea accompanied by a salinity decline and the overall weakening of vertical stratification are referred to as stagnation periods. Extensive stagnation periods occurred in the 1920s/1930s, in the 1950s/1960s and in the 1980s/beginning of 1990s Lehmann et al., 2022). Bottom salinity variations in the Arkona Basin represent water exchange between the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak-Kattegat area. The increasing salinity signal in that area does not indicate that a Major Baltic Inflow has occurred. The mean sea level of the Baltic Sea derived from satellite altimetry data can be used as a proxy for the detection of saline water inflows to the Baltic Sea from the North Sea (Raudsepp et al., 2018). The medium and strong inflow events increase oxygen concentration in the near-bottom layer of the Bornholm Basin while some medium size inflows have no impact on deep water salinity (Mohrholz, 2018). \n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nTime series data of bottom salinity variations in the Arkona Basin are instrumental for monitoring the sporadic nature of water inflow and outflow events. The bottom salinity in the Arkona Basin fluctuates between 11 and 25 g/kg. The highest recorded bottom salinity value is associated with the Major Baltic Inflow of 2014, while other significant salinity peaks align with the Major Baltic Inflows of 1993 and 2002. Low salinity episodes in the Arkona Basin mark the occasions of barotropic outflows of brackish water from the Baltic Sea. In the Bornholm Basin, the bottom salinity record indicates three Major Baltic Inflow events: the first in 1993, followed by 2002, and the most recent in 2014. Following the last Major Baltic Inflow, the bottom salinity in the Bornholm Basin rose to 20 g/kg. Over the subsequent nine years, it has declined to 16 g/kg. The winter of 2023/24 did not experience a Major Baltic Inflow.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00209\n\n**References:**\n\n* Lehmann, A., Myrberg, K., Post, P., Chubarenko, I., Dailidiene, I., Hinrichsen, H.-H., H\u00fcssy, K., Liblik, T., Meier, H.

These Major Baltic Inflows occur seldom, sometimes many years apart (Mohrholz, 2018). The Major Baltic Inflow OMI consists of the time series of the bottom layer salinity in the Arkona Basin and in the Bornholm Basin (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm) and the time-depth plot of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the Gotland Basin. Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen profiles in the Gotland Basin enable us to estimate the amount of the Major Baltic Inflow water that has reached central Baltic, the depth interval of which has been the most affected, and how much the oxygen conditions have been improved. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Baltic Sea is a huge brackish water basin in Northern Europe whose salinity is controlled by its freshwater budget and by the water exchange with the North Sea (e.g. Neumann et al., 2017). This implies that fresher water lies on top of water with higher salinity. The saline water inflows to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits, especially the Major Baltic Inflows, shape hydrophysical conditions in the Gotland Basin of the central Baltic Sea, which in turn have a substantial influence on marine ecology on different trophic levels (Bergen et al., 2018; Raudsepp et al.,2019). In the absence of the Major Baltic Inflows, oxygen in the deeper layers of the Gotland Basin is depleted and replaced by hydrogen sulphide (e.g., Savchuk, 2018). As the Baltic Sea is connected to the North Sea only through very narrow and shallow channels in the Danish Straits, inflows of high salinity and oxygenated water into the Baltic occur only intermittently (e.g., Mohrholz, 2018). Long-lasting periods of oxygen depletion in the deep layers of the central Baltic Sea accompanied by a salinity decline and overall weakening of the vertical stratification are referred to as stagnation periods. Extensive stagnation periods occurred in the 1920s/1930s, in the 1950s/1960s and in the 1980s/beginning of 1990s (Lehmann et al., 2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Major Baltic Inflows of 1993, 2002, and 2014 (BALTIC_OMI_WMHE_mbi_bottom_salinity_arkona_bornholm) present a distinct signal in the Gotland Basin, influencing water salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen up to a depth of 100 meters. Following each event, deep layer salinity in the Gotland Basin increases, reaching peak bottom salinities approximately 1.5 years later, with elevated salinity levels persisting for about three years. Post-2017, salinity below 150 meters has declined, while the halocline has risen, suggesting saline water movement to the Gotland Basin's intermediate layers. Typically, temperatures fall immediately after a Major Baltic Inflow, indicating the descent of cold water from nearby upstream regions to the Gotland Deep's bottom. From 1993 to 1997, deep water temperatures remained relatively low (below 6 \u00b0C). Since 1998, these waters have warmed, with even moderate inflows in 1997/98, 2006/07, and 2018/19 introducing warmer water to the Gotland Basin's bottom layer. From 2019 onwards, water warmer than 7 \u00b0C has filled the layer beneath 100 meters depth. The water temperature below the halocline has risen by approximately 2 \u00b0C since 1993, and the cold intermediate layer's temperature has also increased from 1993 to 2023. Oxygen levels begin to drop sharply after the temporary reoxygenation of the bottom waters. The decline in 2014 was attributed to a shortage of smaller inflows that could bring oxygen-rich water to the Gotland Basin (Neumann et al., 2017) and an increase in biological oxygen demand (Savchuk, 2018; Meier et al., 2018). Additionally, warmer water has accelerated oxygen consumption in the deep layer, leading to increased anoxia. By 2023, oxygen was completely depleted below the depth of 75 metres.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00210\n\n**References:**\n\n* Lehmann, A., Myrberg, K., Post, P., Chubarenko, I., Dailidiene, I., Hinrichsen, H.-H., H\u00fcssy, K., Liblik, T., Meier, H.

(1) The oxygen penetration depth is the depth at which  [O2] < 20\u00b5M, expressed in [m]. (2) The oxygen penetration density is the potential density anomaly at the oxygen penetration depth [kg/m\u00b3]. (3) The oxygen inventory is the vertically integrated oxygen content [mol O2/m\u00b2]. The 20\u00b5M threshold was chosen to minimize the indicator sensitivity to sensor\u2019s precision. Those three metrics are complementary: Oxygen penetration depth is more easily understood, but present more spatial variability. Oxygen penetration density helps in dissociating biogeochemical processes from shifts in the physical structure. Although less intuitive, the oxygen inventory is a more integrative diagnostic and its definition is more easily transposed to other areas.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Black Sea is permanently stratified, due to the contrast in density between large riverine and Mediterranean inflows. This stratification restrains the ventilation of intermediate and deep waters and confines, within a restricted surface layer, the waters that are oxygenated by photosynthesis and exchanges with the atmosphere. The vertical extent of the oxic layer determines the volume of habitat available for pelagic populations (Ostrovskii and Zatsepin 2011, Sak\u0131nan and G\u00fcc\u00fc 2017) and present spatial and temporal variations (Murray et al. 1989; Tugrul et al. 1992; Konovalov and Murray 2001). At long and mid-term, these variations can be monitored with three metrics (Capet et al. 2016), derived from the vertical profiles that can obtained from traditional ship casts or autonomous Argo profilers (Stanev et al., 2013). A large source of uncertainty associated with the spatial and temporal average of those metrics stems from the small number of Argo floats, scarcely adequate to sample the known spatial variability of those metrics.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring the past 60 years, the vertical extent of the Black Sea oxygenated layer has narrowed from 140m to 90m (Capet et al. 2016). The Argo profilers active for 2016 suggested an ongoing deoxygenation trend and indicated an average oxygen penetration depth of 72m at the end of 2016, the lowest value recorded during the past 60 years. The oxygenation of subsurface water is closely related to the intensity of cold water formation, an annual ventilation processes which has been recently limited by warmer-than-usual winter air temperature (Capet et al. 2020). In 2017, 2018 and 2020, cold waters formation resulted in a partial reoxygenation of the intermediate layer. Yet, such ventilation has been lacking in winter 2020-2021, and the updated 2021 indicators reveals the lowest oxygen inventory ever reported in this OMI time series. This results in significant detrimental trends now depicted also over the Argo period (2012-2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00213\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capet, A., Vandenbulcke, L., & Gr\u00e9goire, M.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_007_006) and the Analysis product (BLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_007_003).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multy Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1979-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2020.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, including biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2015, IPCC, 2019). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions (IPCC, 2021).\nSignificant Wave Height mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea region shows west-eastern  dependence demonstrating that the highest values of the average annual 99th percentiles are in the areas where high winds and long fetch are simultaneously present. The largest values of the mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea in the southewestern Black Sea are around 3.5 m, while in the eastern part of the basin are around 2.5 m (Staneva et al., 2019a and 2019b).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSignificant Wave Height mean 99th percentile in the Black Sea region shows west-eastern  dependence with largest values in the southwestern Black Sea, with values as high as 3.5 m, while the 99th percentile values in the eastern part of the basin are around 2.5 m.  The Black Sea, the 99th mean percentile for 2002-2019 shows a similar pattern demonstrating that the highest values of the mean annual 99th percentile are in the western Black Sea. This pattern is consistent with the previous studies, e.g. of (Akp\u0131nar and K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc, 2012; and Akpinar et al., 2016).\nThe anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020 is mostly negative with values down to ~-45 cm. The highest negative anomalies for 2020 are observed in the southeastern area where the multi-year mean 99th percentile is the lowest. The highest positive anomalies of the 99th percentile in 2020 are located in the southwestern Black Sea and along the eastern coast. The map of anomalies for 2020, presenting alternate bands of positive and negative values depending on latitude, is consistent with the yearly west-east displacement of the tracks of the largest storms. \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00214\n\n**References:**\n\n* Akp\u0131nar, A.; K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc, M.\u02d9I.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_007_004) and the Analysis product (BLKSEA_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHYS_007_001).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the Essential Ocean Variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. Particularly in the Black Sea, ocean-atmospheric processes together with its general cyclonic circulation (Rim Current) play an important role on the sea surface temperature variability (Capet et al. 2012). As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. The 99th mean percentile of sea surface temperature provides a worth information about the variability of the sea surface temperature and warming trends but has not been investigated with details in the Black Sea.\nWhile the global-averaged sea surface temperatures have increased since the beginning of the 20th century (Hartmann et al., 2013). Recent studies indicated a warming trend of the sea surface temperature in the Black Sea in the latest years (Mulet et al., 2018; Sakali and Ba\u015fusta, 2018). A specific analysis on the interannual variability of the basin-averaged sea surface temperature revealed a higher positive trend in its eastern region (Ginzburg et al., 2004). For the past three decades, Sakali and Ba\u015fusta (2018) presented an increase in sea surface temperature that varied along both east\u2013west and south\u2013north directions in the Black Sea. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean annual 99th percentile in the period 1993\u20132019 exhibits values ranging from 25.50 to 26.50 oC in the western and central regions of the Black Sea. The values increase towards the east, exceeding 27.5 oC. This contrasting west-east pattern may be linked to the basin wide cyclonic circulation. There are regions showing lower values, below 25.75 oC, such as a small area west of Crimean Peninsula in the vicinity of the Sevastopol anticyclone, the Northern Ukraine region, in particular close to the Odessa and the Karkinytska Gulf due to the freshwaters from the land and a narrow area along the Turkish coastline in the south. Results for 2020 show negative anomalies in the area of influence of the Bosporus and the Bulgarian offshore region up to the Crimean peninsula, while the North West shelf exhibits a positive anomaly as in the Eastern basin. The highest positive value is occurring in the Eastern Tukish coastline nearest the Batumi gyre area. This may be related to the variously increase of sea surface temperature in such a way the southern regions have experienced a higher warming.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00216\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

This OMI is derived from the CMEMS Reprocessed Black Sea L4 SST satellite product (SST_BS_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_022, see e.g. the OMI QUID, http://marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OMI-QUID-BLKSEA-SST.pdf), which provided the SSTs used to compute the evolution of SST anomalies (unfiltered and filtered) over the Black Sea. This reprocessed product consists of daily (nighttime) optimally interpolated 0.05\u00b0 grid resolution SST maps over the Black Sea built from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Merchant et al., 2019) and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) initiatives, including also an adjusted version of the AVHRR Pathfinder dataset version 5.3 (Saha et al., 2018) to increase the input observation coverage. Anomalies are computed against the 1991-2020 reference period. The 30-year climatology 1991-2020 is defined according to the WMO recommendation (WMO, 2017) and recent U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration practice (https://wmo.int/media/news/updated-30-year-reference-period-reflects-changing-climate). The reference for this OMI can be found in the first and second issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report (OSR), Section 1.1 (Roquet et al., 2016; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). In the last decades, since the availability of satellite data (beginning of 1980s), the Black Sea has experienced a warming trend in SST (see e.g. Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2010; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring 2023, the Black Sea basin average SST anomaly was ~1.1 \u00b0C above the 1991-2020 climatology, doubling that of previous year (~0.5 \u00b0C). The Black Sea SST monthly anomalies ranged between -1.0/+1.0 \u00b0C. The highest temperature anomaly (~1.8 \u00b0C) was reached in January 2023, while the lowest (~-0.28 \u00b0C) in May. This year, along with 2022, was characterized by milder temperature anomalies with respect to the previous three consecutive years (2018-2020) marked by peaks of ~3 \u00b0C occurred in May 2018, June 2019, and October 2020.\nOver the period 1982-2023, the Black Sea SST has warmed at a rate of 0.065 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b0C/year, which corresponds to an average increase of about 2.7 \u00b0C during these last 42 years.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00217\n\n**References:**\n\n* Buongiorno Nardelli, B., Colella, S.

The spatial pattern of the Black Sea SST trend reveals a general warming tendency, ranging from 0.053 \u00b0C/year to 0.080 \u00b0C/year. The spatial pattern of SST trend is rather homogeneous over the whole basin. Highest values characterize the eastern basin, where the trend reaches the extreme value, while lower values are found close to the western coasts, in correspondence of main rivers inflow. The Black Sea SST trend continues to show the highest intensity among all the other European Seas.\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00218\n\n**References:**\n\n* Buongiorno Nardelli, B., Colella, S.

This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves.\n \nThe global wave system of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project \u00ab my wave \u00bb (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10\u00b0. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in primary and secondary swells.\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00017\n\n**References:**\n\n* F.

It is expressed in PgC per year. The ocean monitoring index is presented for the period 1985 to year-1. The yearly estimate of the ocean CO2 sink corresponds to the mean of a 100-member ensemble of CO2 flux estimates (Chau et al. 2022). The range of an estimate with the associated uncertainty is then defined by the empirical 68% interval computed from the ensemble.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSince the onset of the industrial era in 1750, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased from about 277\u00b13 ppm (Joos and Spahni, 2008) to 412.44\u00b10.1 ppm in 2020 (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2020). By 2011, the ocean had absorbed approximately 28 \u00b1 5% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus providing negative feedback to global warming and climate change (Ciais et al., 2013). The ocean CO2 sink is evaluated every year as part of the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2022). The uptake of CO2 occurs primarily in response to increasing atmospheric levels. The global flux is characterized by a significant variability on interannual to decadal time scales largely in response to natural climate variability (e.g., ENSO) (Friedlingstein et al. 2022, Chau et al. 2022). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe rate of change of the integrated yearly surface downward flux has increased by 0.04\u00b10.03e-1 PgC/yr2 over the period 1985 to year-1. The yearly flux time series shows a plateau in the 90s followed by an increase since 2000 with a growth rate of 0.06\u00b10.04e-1 PgC/yr2. In  2021 (resp. 2020), the global ocean CO2 sink was    2.41\u00b10.13 (resp.  2.50\u00b10.12) PgC/yr. The average over the full period is 1.61\u00b10.10 PgC/yr with an interannual variability (temporal standard deviation) of 0.46 PgC/yr.  In order to compare these fluxes to Friedlingstein et al. (2022), the estimate of preindustrial outgassing of riverine carbon of  0.61 PgC/yr, which is in between the estimate by Jacobson et al. (2007) (0.45\u00b10.18 PgC/yr) and the one by Resplandy et al. (2018) (0.78\u00b10.41 PgC/yr) needs to be added. A full discussion regarding this OMI can be found in section 2.10 of the Ocean State Report 4 (Gehlen et al., 2020) and in Chau et al.

The observed decrease in ocean pH resulting from increasing concentrations of CO2 is an important indicator of global change. The estimate of global mean pH builds on a reconstruction methodology, \n* Obtain values for alkalinity based on the so called \u201clocally interpolated alkalinity regression (LIAR)\u201d method after Carter et al., 2016; 2018. \n* Build on surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CMEMS product: MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008) obtained from an ensemble of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (Chau et al. 2022) which exploit sampling data gathered in the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) (https://www.socat.info/)\n* Derive a gridded field of ocean surface pH based on the van Heuven et al., (2011) CO2 system calculations using reconstructed pCO2 (MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008) and alkalinity.\nThe global mean average of pH at yearly time steps is then calculated from the gridded ocean surface pH field. It is expressed in pH unit on total hydrogen ion scale. In the figure, the amplitude of the uncertainty (1\u03c3  ) of yearly mean surface sea water pH varies at a range of (0.0023, 0.0029) pH unit (see Quality Information Document for more details). The trend and uncertainty estimates amount to -0.0017\u00b10.0004e-1 pH units per year.\nThe indicator is derived from in situ observations of CO2 fugacity (SOCAT data base, www.socat.info, Bakker et al., 2016). These observations are still sparse in space and time.  Monitoring pH at higher space and time resolutions, as well as in coastal regions will require a denser network of observations and preferably direct pH measurements.  \nA full discussion regarding this OMI can be found in section 2.10 of the Ocean State Report 4 (Gehlen et al., 2020).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe decrease in surface ocean pH is a direct consequence of the uptake by the ocean of carbon dioxide. It is referred to as ocean acidification. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Workshop on Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Marine Biology and Ecosystems (2011) defined Ocean Acidification as \u201ca reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean\u201d. The pH of contemporary surface ocean waters is already 0.1 lower than at pre-industrial times and an additional decrease by 0.33 pH units is projected over the 21st century in response to the high concentration pathway RCP8.5 (Bopp et al., 2013). Ocean acidification will put marine ecosystems at risk (e.g. Orr et al., 2005; Gehlen et al., 2011; Kroeker et al., 2013). The monitoring of surface ocean pH has become a focus of many international scientific initiatives (http://goa-on.org/) and constitutes one target for SDG14 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg14).  \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince the year 1985, global ocean surface pH is decreasing at a rate of  -0.0017\u00b10.0004e-1 per year. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00224\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bakker, D. et al.: A multi-decade record of high-quality fCO2 data in version 3 of the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT), Earth Syst.

This indicator is derived from monthly pH time series distributed with the Copernicus Marine product MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008 (Chau et al., 2022a). For each grid cell, a linear least-squares regression was used to fit a linear function of pH versus time, where the slope (\u03bc) and residual standard deviation (\u03c3) are defined as estimates of the long-term trend and associated uncertainty. Finally, the estimates of pH associated with the highest uncertainty, i.e.,  \u03c3-to-\u00b5 ratio over a threshold of 1  0%, are excluded from the global trend map (see QUID document for detailed description and method illustrations). This threshold is chosen at the 90th confidence level of all ratio values computed across the global ocean.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nA decrease in surface ocean pH (i.e., ocean acidification) is primarily a consequence of an increase in ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations that have been augmented by anthropogenic emissions (Bates et al, 2014; Gattuso et al, 2015; P\u00e9rez et al, 2021).      As projected in Gattuso et al (2015), \u201cunder our current rate of emissions, most marine organisms evaluated will have very high risk of impacts by 2100 and many by 2050\u201d. Ocean acidification is thus an ongoing source of concern due to its strong influence on marine ecosystems (e.g., Doney et al., 2009; Gehlen et al., 2011; P\u00f6rtner et al. 2019). Tracking changes in yearly mean values of surface ocean pH at the global scale has become an important indicator of both ocean acidification and global change (Gehlen et al., 2020; Chau et al., 2022b). In line with a sustained establishment of ocean measuring stations and thus a rapid increase in observations of ocean pH and other carbonate variables (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and CO2 fugacity) since the last decades (Bakker et al., 2016; Lauvset et al., 2021), recent studies including Bates et al (2014), Lauvset et al (2015), and P\u00e9rez et al (2021) put attention on analyzing secular trends of pH and their drivers from time-series stations to ocean basins. This OMI consists of the global maps of long-term pH trends and associated 1\u03c3-uncertainty derived from the Copernicus Marine data-based product of monthly surface water pH (Chau et al., 2022a) at 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 grid cells over the global ocean.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSince 1985, pH has been decreasing at a rate between -0.0008 yr-1 and -0.0022 yr-1 over most of the global ocean basins. Tropical and subtropical regions, the eastern equatorial Pacific excepted, show pH trends falling in the interquartile range of all the trend estimates (between -0.0012 yr-1 and -0.0018 yr-1). pH over the eastern equatorial Pacific decreases much faster, reaching a growth rate larger than -0.0024 yr-1. Such a high rate of change in pH is also observed over a sector south of the Indian Ocean. Part of the polar and subpolar North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean has no significant trend.  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00277\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bakker, D. C.

The regional thermosteric sea level values are then averaged from 60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N aiming to monitor interannual to long term global sea level variations caused by temperature driven ocean volume changes through thermal expansion as expressed in meters (m).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nMost of the interannual variability and trends in regional sea level is caused by changes in steric sea level. At mid and low latitudes, the steric sea level signal is essentially due to temperature changes, i.e. the thermosteric effect (Stammer et al., 2013, Meyssignac et al., 2016). Salinity changes play only a local role. Regional trends of thermosteric sea level can be significantly larger compared to their globally averaged versions (Storto et al., 2018). Except for shallow shelf sea and high latitudes (> 60\u00b0 latitude), regional thermosteric sea level variations are mostly related to ocean circulation changes, in particular in the tropics where the sea level variations and trends are the most intense over the last two decades. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSignificant (i.e. when the signal exceeds the noise) regional trends for the period 2005-2019 from the Copernicus Marine Service multi-ensemble approach show a thermosteric sea level rise at rates ranging from the global mean average up to more than 8 mm/year. There are specific regions where a negative trend is observed above noise at rates up to about -8 mm/year such as in the subpolar North Atlantic, or the western tropical Pacific. These areas are characterized by strong year-to-year variability (Dubois et al., 2018; Capotondi et al., 2020). \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00241\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capotondi, A., Wittenberg, A.T., Kug, J.-S., Takahashi, K. and McPhaden, M.J.

A multi-product approach is used, meaning that the linear change is first computed for 5 different zonal mean temperature estimates. The average linear change is then computed, as well as the standard deviation between the five linear change computations. The evaluation method relies in the study of the consistency in between the 5 different estimates, which provides a qualitative estimate of the robustness of the indicator. See Mulet et al. (2018) for more details.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nLarge-scale temperature variations in the upper layers are mainly related to the heat exchange with the atmosphere and surrounding oceanic regions, while the deeper ocean temperature in the main thermocline and below varies due to many dynamical forcing mechanisms (Bindoff et al., 2019). Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation (IPCC, 2019), ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in ecosystem assemblages, biodiversity, population extinctions, coral bleaching and infectious disease, change in behavior (including reproduction), as well as redistribution of habitat (e.g. Gattuso et al., 2015, Molinos et al., 2016, Ramirez et al., 2017). Ocean warming also intensifies tropical cyclones (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Trenberth et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2017).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe results show an overall ocean warming of the upper global ocean over the period 1993-2019, particularly in the upper 300m depth. In some areas, this warming signal reaches down to about 800m depth such as for example in the Southern Ocean south of 40\u00b0S. In other areas, the signal-to-noise ratio in the deeper ocean layers is less than two, i.e. the different products used for the ensemble mean show weak agreement. However, interannual-to-decadal fluctuations are superposed on the warming signal, and can interfere with the warming trend. For example, in the subpolar North Atlantic decadal variations such as the so called \u2018cold event\u2019 prevail (Dubois et al., 2018; Gourrion et al., 2018), and the cumulative trend over a quarter of a decade does not exceed twice the noise level below about 100m depth.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00244\n\n**References:**\n\n* Dubois, C., K. von Schuckmann, S.

It provides insight into the flow of heat into and out of the ocean, into modes of variability in the ocean and atmosphere, can be used to identify features in the ocean such as fronts and upwelling, and knowledge of SST is also required for applications such as ocean and weather prediction (Roquet et al., 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the period 1993 to 2021, the global average linear trend was 0.015 \u00b1 0.001\u00b0C / year (95% confidence interval). 2021 is nominally the sixth warmest year in the time series. Aside from this trend, variations in the time series can be seen which are associated with changes between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a conditions. For example, peaks in the time series coincide with the strong El Ni\u00f1o events that occurred in 1997/1998 and 2015/2016 (Gasparin et al., 2018).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00242\n\n**References:**\n\n* GCOS.

The method also calculates the 95% confidence range in the slope.  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is one of the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as being needed for monitoring and characterising the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). It provides insight into the flow of heat into and out of the ocean, into modes of variability in the ocean and atmosphere, can be used to identify features in the ocean such as fronts and upwelling, and knowledge of SST is also required for applications such as ocean and weather prediction (Roquet et al., 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWarming trends occurred over most of the globe between 1993 and 2021. One of the exceptions is the North Atlantic, which has a region south of Greenland where a cooling trend is found. The cooling in this area has been previously noted as occurring on centennial time scales (IPCC, 2013; Caesar et al., 2018; Sevellee et al., 2017).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00243\n\n**References:**\n\n* Caesar, L., Rahmstorf, S., Robinson, A., Feulner, G. and Saba, V., 2018.

For each latitudinal point from 27\u00b0N to 42\u00b0N the Coastal Upwelling Index is defined as the temperature difference between the maximum and minimum temperature in a range of distance from the coast up to 3.5\u00ba westwards.\n\u3016CUI\u3017_lat=max\u2061(T_lat )-min\u2061(T_lat)\nA high Coastal Upwelling Index indicates intense upwelling conditions.\nThe index is computed from the following Copernicus Marine products:\n\tIBI-MYP: IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002 (1993-2019)\n\tIBI-NRT: IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHYS_005_001 (2020 onwards)\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nCoastal upwelling process occurs along coastlines as the result of deflection of the oceanic water away from the shore. Such deflection is produced by Ekman transport induced by persistent winds parallel to the coastline (Sverdrup, 1938). When this transported water is forced, the mass balance is maintained by pumping of ascending intermediate water. This water is typically denser, cooler and richer in nutrients. The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland domain contains two well-documented Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems, they are hosted under the same system known as Canary Current Upwelling System (Fraga, 1981; Hempel, 1982). This system is one of the major coastal upwelling regions of the world and it is produced by the eastern closure of the Subtropical Gyre. The North West African (NWA) coast presents an intense upwelling region that extends from Morocco to south of Senegal, likewise the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) shows a seasonal upwelling behavior. These two upwelling domains are separated by the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz, where the coastline does not allow the formation of upwelling conditions from 34\u00baN up to 37\u00baN.\nThe Copernicus Marine Service Coastal Upwelling Index is defined following the steps of several previous upwelling indices described in literature. More details and full scientific evaluation can be found in the dedicated section in the first issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State report (Sotillo et al., 2016).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe NWA coast (latitudes below 34\u00baN) shows  a quite constantlow variability of the periodicity and the intensity of the upwelling, few periods of upwelling intensifications are found in years 1993-1995, and 2003-2004.\nIn the IP coast (latitudes higher than 37\u00baN) the interannual variability is more remarkable showing years with high upwelling activity (1994, 2004, and 2015-2017) followed by periods of lower activity (1996-1998, 2003, 2011, and 2013).\nAccording to the results of the IBI-NRT system, 2020 was a year with weak upwelling in the IP latitudes. \nWhile in the NWA coast the upwelling activity was more intense than the average.\nThe analysis of trends in the period 1993-2019 shows significant positive trend of the upwelling index in the IP latitudes. This trend implies an increase of temperature differences between the coastal and offshore waters of approximately 0.02 \u00b0C/Year.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00248\n\n**References:**\n\n* Fraga F. 1981.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (IBI_MULTIYEAR_WAV_005_006) and the Analysis product (IBI_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_005_005).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n\u2022\tMap of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi-Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1993-2021).\n\u2022\tAnomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022: The 99th percentile of the year 2022 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2022.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect dramatically maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, impacting therefore on the biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2019). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions.\nThe Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region, which covers the North-East Atlantic Ocean from Canary Islands to Ireland, is characterized by two different sea state wave climate regions: whereas the northern half, impacted by the North Atlantic subpolar front, is of one of the world\u2019s greatest wave generating regions (M\u00f8rk et al., 2010; Folley, 2017), the southern half,  located at subtropical latitudes, is by contrast influenced by persistent trade winds and thus by constant and moderate wave regimes.\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which refers to changes in the atmospheric sea level pressure difference between the Azores and Iceland, is a significant driver of wave climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. The influence of North Atlantic Oscillation on waves along the Atlantic coast of Europe is particularly strong in and has a major impact on northern latitudes wintertime (Mart\u00ednez-Asensio et al. 2016; Bacon and Carter, 1991; Bouws et al., 1996; Bauer, 2001; Wolf et al., 2002; Gleeson et al., 2017). Swings in the North Atlantic Oscillation index produce changes in the storms track and subsequently in the wind speed and direction over the Atlantic that alter the wave regime. When North Atlantic Oscillation index is in its positive phase, storms usually track northeast of Europe and enhanced westerly winds induce higher than average waves in the northernmost Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, in the negative North Atlantic Oscillation phase, the track of the storms is more zonal and south than usual, with trade winds (mid latitude westerlies) being slower and producing higher than average waves in southern latitudes (Marshall et al., 2001; Wolf et al., 2002; Wolf and Woolf, 2006).   \nAdditionally a variety of previous studies have uniquevocally determined the relationship between the sea state variability in the IBI region and other atmospheric climate modes such as the East Atlantic pattern, the Arctic Oscillation, the East Atlantic Western Russian pattern and the Scandinavian pattern (Izaguirre et al., 2011, Mart\u00ednez-Asensio et al., 2016). \nIn this context, long\u2010term statistical analysis of reanalyzed model data is mandatory not only to disentangle other driving agents of wave climate but also to attempt inferring any potential trend in the number and/or intensity of extreme wave events in coastal areas with subsequent socio-economic and environmental consequences.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe climatic mean of 99th percentile (1993-2021) reveals a north-south gradient of Significant Wave Height with the highest values in northern latitudes (above 8m) and lowest values (2-3 m) detected southeastward of Canary Islands, in the seas between Canary Islands and the African Continental Shelf. This north-south pattern is the result of the two climatic conditions prevailing in the region and previously described.\nThe 99th percentile anomalies in 2023 show that during this period, the central latitudes of the domain (between 37 \u00baN and 50 \u00baN) were affected by extreme wave events that exceeded up to twice the standard deviation of the anomalies. These events impacted not only the open waters of the Northeastern Atlantic but also European coastal areas such as the west coast of Portugal, the Spanish Atlantic coast, and the French coast, including the English Channel.\nAdditionally, the impact of significant wave extremes exceeding twice the standard deviation of anomalies was detected in the Mediterranean region of the Balearic Sea and the Algerian Basin. This pattern is commonly associated with the impact of intense Tramontana winds originating from storms that cross the Iberian Peninsula from the Gulf of Biscay.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nIberia-Biscay-Ireland Significant Wave Height extreme variability: Map of the 99th mean percentile computed from the Multi Year Product (left panel) and anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022 computed from the Analysis product (right panel).

The anomaly of exceeding a threshold of Significant Wave Height is used to characterize the wave behavior. A sensitivity test of the threshold has been performed evaluating the differences using several ones (percentiles 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95). From this indicator, it has been chosen the 90th percentile as the most representative, coinciding with the state-of-the-art.\nTwo CMEMS products are used to compute the Strong Wave Incidence index:\n\u2022\tIBI-WAV-MYP: IBI_REANALYSIS_WAV_005_006\n\u2022\tIBI-WAV-NRT: IBI_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_005_005\nThe Strong Wave Incidence index (SWI) is defined as the difference between the climatic frequency of exceedance (Fclim) and the observational frequency of exceedance (Fobs) of the threshold defined by the 90th percentile (ThP90) of Significant Wave Height (SWH) computed on a monthly basis from hourly data of IBI-WAV-MYP product:\nSWI = Fobs(SWH > ThP90) \u2013 Fclim(SWH > ThP90)\nSince the Strong Wave Incidence index is defined as a difference of a climatic mean and an observed value, it can be considered an anomaly. Such index represents the percentage that the stormy conditions have occurred above/below the climatic average. Thus, positive/negative values indicate the percentage of hourly data that exceed the threshold above/below the climatic average, respectively.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOcean waves have a high relevance over the coastal ecosystems and human activities. Extreme wave events can entail severe impacts over human infrastructures and coastal dynamics. However, the incidence of severe (90th percentile) wave events also have valuable relevance affecting the development of human activities and coastal environments. The Strong Wave Incidence index based on the CMEMS regional analysis and reanalysis product provides information on the frequency of severe wave events.\nThe IBI-MFC covers the Europe\u2019s Atlantic coast in a region bounded by the 26\u00baN and 56\u00baN parallels, and the 19\u00baW and 5\u00baE meridians. The western European coast is located at the end of the long fetch of the subpolar North Atlantic (M\u00f8rk et al., 2010), one of the world\u2019s greatest wave generating regions (Folley, 2017). Several studies have analyzed changes of the ocean wave variability in the North Atlantic Ocean (Bacon and Carter, 1991; Kursnir et al., 1997; WASA Group, 1998; Bauer, 2001; Wang and Swail, 2004; Dupuis et al., 2006; Wolf and Woolf, 2006; Dodet et al., 2010; Young et al., 2011; Young and Ribal, 2019). The observed variability is composed of fluctuations ranging from the weather scale to the seasonal scale, together with long-term fluctuations on interannual to decadal scales associated with large-scale climate oscillations. Since the ocean surface state is mainly driven by wind stresses, part of this variability in Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region is connected to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (Bacon and Carter, 1991; Hurrell, 1995;  Bouws et al., 1996, Bauer, 2001; Woolf et al., 2002; Tsimplis et al., 2005; Gleeson et al., 2017). However, later studies have quantified the relationships between the wave climate and other atmospheric climate modes such as the East Atlantic pattern, the Arctic Oscillation pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian pattern and the Scandinavian pattern (Izaguirre et al., 2011, Mat\u00ednez-Asensio et al., 2016).\nThe Strong Wave Incidence index provides information on incidence of stormy events in four monitoring regions in the IBI domain. The selected monitoring regions (Figure 1.A) are aimed to provide a summarized view of the diverse climatic conditions in the IBI regional domain: Wav1 region monitors the influence of stormy conditions in the West coast of Iberian Peninsula, Wav2 region is devoted to monitor the variability of stormy conditions in the Bay of Biscay, Wav3 region is focused in the northern half of IBI domain, this region is strongly affected by the storms transported by the subpolar front, and Wav4 is focused in the influence of marine storms in the North-East African Coast, the Gulf of Cadiz and Canary Islands.\nMore details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Pascual et al., 2020).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe analysis of the index in the last decades do not show significant trends of the strong wave conditions over the period 1992-2021 with 99% confidence. The maximum wave event reported in region WAV1 (B) occurred in February 2014, producing an increment of 25% of strong wave conditions in the region. Two maximum wave events are found in WAV2 (C) with an increment of 15% of high wave conditions in November 2009 and February 2014. As in regions WAV1 and WAV2, in the region WAV3 (D), a strong wave event took place in February 2014, this event is one of the maximum events reported in the region with an increment of strong wave conditions of 20%, two months before (December 2013) there was a storm of similar characteristics affecting this region, other events of similar magnitude are detected on October 2000 and November 2009. The region WAV4 (E) present its maximum wave event in January 1996, such event produced a 25% of increment of strong wave conditions in the region. Despite of each monitoring region is affected by independent wave events; the analysis shows several past higher-than-average wave events that were propagated though several monitoring regions: November-December 2010 (WAV3 and WAV2); February 2014 (WAV1, WAV2, and WAV3); and February-March 2018 (WAV1 and WAV4).\nThe analysis of the NRT period (January 2022 onwards) depicts a significant event that occurred in November 2022, which affected the WAV2 and WAV3 regions, resulting in a 15% and 25% increase in maximum wave conditions, respectively. In the case of the WAV3 region, this event was the strongest event recorded in this region.\nIn the WAV4 region, an event that occurred in February 2024 was the second most intense on record, showing an 18% increase in strong wave conditions in the region.\nIn the WAV1 region, the NRT period includes two high-intensity events that occurred in February 2024 (21% increase in strong wave conditions) and April 2022 (18% increase in maximum wave conditions).\n\n**Figure caption**\n\n(A) Mean 90th percentile of Sea Wave Height computed from IBI_REANALYSIS_WAV_005_006 product at an hourly basis.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002) and the Analysis product (IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_005_001).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n\u2022\tMap of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2021).\n\u2022\tAnomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022: The 99th percentile of the year 2022 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2022 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the essential ocean variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. While the global-averaged sea surface temperatures have increased since the beginning of the 20th century (Hartmann et al., 2013) in the North Atlantic, anomalous cold conditions have also been reported since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al., 2018).\n\nThe IBI area is a complex dynamic region with a remarkable variety of ocean physical processes and scales involved. The Sea Surface Temperature field in the region is strongly dependent on latitude, with higher values towards the South (Locarnini et al. 2013). This latitudinal gradient is supported by the presence of the eastern part of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre that transports cool water from the northern latitudes towards the equator. Additionally, the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region is under the influence of the Sea Level Pressure dipole established between the Icelandic low and the Bermuda high. Therefore, the interannual and interdecadal variability of the surface temperature field may be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern (Czaja and Frankignoul, 2002; Flatau et al., 2003).\nAlso relevant in the region are the upwelling processes taking place in the coastal margins. The most referenced one is the eastern boundary coastal upwelling system off the African and western Iberian coast (Sotillo et al., 2016), although other smaller upwelling systems have also been described in the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Alvarez et al., 2011), the south-western Irish coast (Edwars et al., 1996) and the European Continental Slope (Dickson, 1980).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the IBI region, the 99th mean percentile for 1993-2021 shows a north-south pattern driven by the climatological distribution of temperatures in the North Atlantic. In the coastal regions of Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, the mean values are influenced by the upwelling processes (Sotillo et al., 2016). These results are consistent with the ones presented in \u00c1lvarez Fanjul (2019) for the period 1993-2016.\nThe analysis of the 99th percentile anomaly in the year 2023 shows that this period has been affected by a severe impact of maximum SST values. Anomalies exceeding the standard deviation affect almost the entire IBI domain, and regions impacted by thermal anomalies surpassing twice the standard deviation are also widespread below the 43\u00baN parallel.\nExtreme SST values exceeding twice the standard deviation affect not only the open ocean waters but also the easter boundary upwelling areas such as the northern half of Portugal, the Spanish Atlantic coast up to Cape Ortegal, and the African coast south of Cape Aguer.\nIt is worth noting the impact of anomalies that exceed twice the standard deviation is widespread throughout the entire Mediterranean region included in this analysis.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nIberia-Biscay-Ireland Surface Temperature extreme variability: Map of the 99th mean percentile computed from the Multi Year Product (left panel) and anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2022 computed from the Analysis product (right panel).

The salinity data are extracted from several CMEMS products and averaged in the corresponding monitoring domain: \n* IBI-MYP: IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002\n* IBI-NRT: IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHYS_005_001\n* GLO-MYP: GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_030\n* CORA: INSITU_GLO_TS_REP_OBSERVATIONS_013_002_b\n* ARMOR: MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012\n\nThe anomalies of salinity have been computed relative to the monthly climatology obtained from IBI-MYP. Outcomes from diverse products are combined to deliver a unique multi-product result. Multi-year products (IBI-MYP, GLO,MYP, CORA, and ARMOR) are used to show an ensemble mean and the standard deviation of members in the covered period. The IBI-NRT short-range product is not included in the ensemble, but used to provide the deterministic analysis of salinity anomalies in the most recent year.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Mediterranean Outflow Water is a saline and warm water mass generated from the mixing processes of the North Atlantic Central Water and the Mediterranean waters overflowing the Gibraltar sill (Daniault et al., 1994). The resulting water mass is accumulated in an area west of the Iberian Peninsula (Daniault et al., 1994) and spreads into the North Atlantic following advective pathways (Holliday et al. 2003; Lozier and Stewart 2008, de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019).\nThe importance of the heat and salt transport promoted by the Mediterranean Outflow Water flow has implications beyond the boundaries of the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland domain (Reid 1979, Paillet et al. 1998, van Aken 2000). For example, (i) it contributes substantially to the salinity of the Norwegian Current (Reid 1979), (ii) the mixing processes with the Labrador Sea Water promotes a salt transport into the inner North Atlantic (Talley and MacCartney, 1982; van Aken, 2000), and (iii) the deep anti-cyclonic Meddies developed in the African slope is a cause of the large-scale westward penetration of Mediterranean salt (Iorga and Lozier, 1999).\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the core of Mediterranean Outflow Water is affected by inter-annual variability. This variability is mainly caused by a shift of the MOW dominant northward-westward pathways (Bozec et al. 2011), it is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (Bozec et al. 2011) and leads to the displacement of the boundaries of the water core (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019). The variability of the advective pathways of MOW is an oceanographic process that conditions the destination of the Mediterranean salt transport in the North Atlantic. Therefore, monitoring the Mediterranean Outflow Water variability becomes decisive to have a proper understanding of the climate system and its evolution (e.g. Bozec et al. 2011, Pascual-Collar et al. 2019).\nThe CMEMS IBI-OMI_WMHE_mow product is aimed to monitor the inter-annual variability of the Mediterranean Outflow Water in the North Atlantic. The objective is the establishment of a long-term monitoring program to observe the variability and trends of the Mediterranean water mass in the IBI regional seas. To do that, the salinity anomaly is monitored in key areas selected to represent the main reservoir and the three main advective spreading pathways. More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report Pascual et al., 2018 and de Pascual-Collar et al. 2019.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe absence of long-term trends in the monitoring domain Reservoir (b) suggests the steadiness of water mass properties involved on the formation of Mediterranean Outflow Water.\nResults obtained in monitoring box North (c) present an alternance of periods with positive and negative anomalies. The last negative period started in 2016 reaching up to the present. Such negative events are linked to the decrease of the northward pathway of Mediterranean Outflow Water (Bozec et al., 2011), which appears to return to steady conditions in 2020 and 2021. \nResults for box West (d) reveal a cycle of negative (2015-2017) and positive (2017 up to the present) anomalies. The positive anomalies of salinity in this region are correlated with an increase of the westward transport of salinity into the inner North Atlantic (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019), which appear to be maintained for years 2020-2021.\nResults in monitoring boxes North and West are consistent with independent studies (Bozec et al., 2011; and de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019), suggesting a westward displacement of Mediterranean Outflow Water and the consequent contraction of the northern boundary.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00258\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bozec A, Lozier MS, Chassignet EP, Halliwell GR. 2011.

It contains a Reanalysis dataset, an Interim dataset covering the period after the reanalysis until 1 month before present and a monthly climatological dataset (reference period 1993-2016). The Reanalysis dataset is a multi-year wave reanalysis starting from January 1985, composed by hourly wave parameters at 1/24\u00b0 horizontal resolution, covering the Mediterranean Sea and extending up to 18.125W into the Atlantic Ocean. The Med-WAV modelling system is based on wave model WAM 4.6.2 and has been developed as a nested sequence of two computational grids (coarse and fine) to ensure that swell propagating from the North Atlantic (NA) towards the strait of Gibraltar is correctly entering the Mediterranean Sea. The coarse grid covers the North Atlantic Ocean from 75\u00b0W to 10\u00b0E and from 70\u00b0 N to 10\u00b0 S in 1/6\u00b0 resolution while the nested fine grid covers the Mediterranean Sea from 18.125\u00b0 W to 36.2917\u00b0 E and from 30.1875\u00b0 N to 45.9792\u00b0 N with a 1/24\u00b0 resolution. The modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins.  The wave system also includes an optimal interpolation assimilation scheme assimilating significant wave height along track satellite observations available through CMEMS and it is forced with daily averaged currents from Med-Physics and with 1-h, 0.25\u00b0 horizontal-resolution ERA5 reanalysis 10m-above-sea-surface winds from ECMWF.  \n\n_Product Citation_: Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169\n\n_DOI (Product)_: https://doi.org/10.25423/cmcc/medsea_multiyear_wav_006_012   \n\n_DOI (Interim dataset)_:    \nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/ CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012_MEDWAM3I  \n                                                                                                                                                      \n_DOI (climatological dataset)_:    \nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/ CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012_CLIM  \n\n**DOI (Interim dataset)**:\nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/ CMCC/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012_MEDWAM3I\n\n**References:**\n\n* Korres, G., Ravdas, M., Denaxa, D., & Sotiropoulou, M.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012) and the Analysis product (MEDSEA_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_006_017).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multy Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged in the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile to the percentile in 2020.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of annual significant wave height and evaluate the spatio-temporal variability. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This approach was first successfully applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al., 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and \u00c1lvarez-Fanjul et al., 2019). Further details and in-depth scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (\u00c1lvarez- Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe sea state and its related spatio-temporal variability affect maritime activities and the physical connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems, impacting therefore on the biodiversity of marine protected areas (Gonz\u00e1lez-Marco et al., 2008; Savina et al., 2003; Hewitt, 2003). Over the last decades, significant attention has been devoted to extreme wave height events since their destructive effects in both the shoreline environment and human infrastructures have prompted a wide range of adaptation strategies to deal with natural hazards in coastal areas (Hansom et al., 2014). Complementarily, there is also an emerging question about the role of anthropogenic global climate change on present and future extreme wave conditions.\nThe Mediterranean Sea is an almost enclosed basin where the complexity of its orographic characteristics deeply influences the atmospheric circulation at local scale, giving rise to strong regional wind regimes (Drobinski et al. 2018). Therefore, since waves are primarily driven by winds, high waves are present over most of the Mediterranean Sea and tend to reach the highest values where strong wind and long fetch (i.e. the horizontal distance over which wave-generating winds blow) are simultaneously present (Lionello et al. 2006). Specifically, as seen in figure and in agreement with other studies (e.g. Sartini et al. 2017), the highest values (5 \u2013 6 m in figure, top) extend from the Gulf of Lion to the southwestern Sardinia through the Balearic Sea and are sustained southwards approaching the Algerian coast. They result from northerly winds dominant in the western Mediterranean Sea (Mistral or Tramontana), that become stronger due to orographic effects (Menendez et al. 2014), and act over a large area. In the Ionian Sea, the northerly Mistral wind is still the main cause of high waves (4-5 m in figure, top). In the Aegean and Levantine Seas, high waves (4-5 m in figure, top) are caused by the northerly Bora winds, prevalent in winter, and the northerly Etesian winds, prevalent in summer (Lionello et al. 2006; Chronis et al. 2011; Menendez et al. 2014). In general, northerly winds are responsible for most high waves in the Mediterranean (e.g. Chronis et al. 2011; Menendez et al. 2014). In agreement with figure (top), studies on the eastern Mediterranean and the Hellenic Seas have found that the typical wave height range in the Aegean Sea is similar to the one observed in the Ionian Sea despite the shorter fetches characterizing the former basin (Zacharioudaki et al. 2015). This is because of the numerous islands in the Aegean Sea which cause wind funneling and enhance the occurrence of extreme winds and thus of extreme waves (Kotroni et al. 2001). Special mention should be made of the high waves, sustained throughout the year, observed east and west of the island of Crete, i.e. around the exiting points of the northerly airflow in the Aegean Sea (Zacharioudaki et al. 2015). This airflow is characterized by consistently high magnitudes that are sustained during all seasons in contrast to other airflows in the Mediterranean Sea that exhibit a more pronounced seasonality (Chronis et al. 2011). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn 2020 (bottom panel), higher-than-average values of the 99th percentile of Significant Wave Height are seen over most of the northern Mediterranean Sea, in the eastern Alboran Sea, and along stretches of the African coast (Tunisia, Libya and Egypt). In many cases they exceed the climatic standard deviation. Regions where the climatic standard deviation is exceeded twice are the European and African coast of the eastern Alboran Sea, a considerable part of the eastern Spanish coast, the Ligurian Sea and part of the east coast of France as well as areas of the southern Adriatic. These anomalies correspond to the maximum positive anomalies computed in the Mediterranean Sea for year 2020 with values that reach up to 1.1 m. Spatially constrained maxima are also found at other coastal stretches (e.g. Algeri, southeast Sardinia).  Part of the positive anomalies found along the French and Spanish coast, including the coast of the Balearic Islands, can be associated with the wind storm \u201cGloria\u201d (19/1 \u2013 24/1) during which exceptional eastern winds originated in the Ligurian Sea and propagated westwards. The storm, which was of a particularly high intensity and long duration, caused record breaking wave heights in the region, and, in return, great damage to the coast (Amores et al., 2020; de Alfonso et al., 2021). Other storms that could have contributed to the positive anomalies observed in the western Mediterranean Sea include: storm Karine (25/2 \u2013 5/4), which caused high waves from the eastern coast of Spain to the Balearic Islands (Copernicus, Climate Change Service, 2020); storm Bernardo (7/11 \u2013 18/11) which also affected the Balearic islands and the Algerian coast and; storm Herv\u00e9 (2/2 \u2013 8/2) during which the highest wind gust was recorded at north Corsica (Wikiwand, 2021). In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the medicane Ianos (14/9 \u2013 21/9) may have contributed to the positive anomalies shown in the central Ionian Sea since this area coincides with the area of peak wave height values during the medicane (Copernicus, 2020a and Copernicus, 2020b). Otherwise, higher-than-average values in the figure are the result of severe, yet not unusual, wind events, which occurred during the year. Negative anomalies occur over most of the southern Mediterranean Sea, east of the Alboran Sea. The maximum negative anomalies reach about -1 m and are located in the southeastern Ionian Sea and west of the south part of mainland Greece as well as in coastal locations of the north and east Aegean  They appear to be quite unusual since they are greater than two times the climatic standard deviation in the region. They could imply less severe southerly wind activity during 2020 (Drobinski et al., 2018). \n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00262\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Multi Year Product (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004) and the Analysis product (MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_006_013).\nTwo parameters have been considered for this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1987-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Near Real Time product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Sea Surface Temperature is one of the Essential Ocean Variables, hence the monitoring of this variable is of key importance, since its variations can affect the ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. As the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, trends of sea surface temperature can also have an effect on the global climate. In recent decades (from mid \u201880s) the Mediterranean Sea showed a trend of increasing temperatures (Ducrocq et al., 2016), which has been observed also by means of the CMEMS SST_MED_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_021 satellite product and reported in the following CMEMS OMI: MEDSEA_OMI_TEMPSAL_sst_area_averaged_anomalies and MEDSEA_OMI_TEMPSAL_sst_trend.\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a semi-enclosed sea characterized by an annual average surface temperature which varies horizontally from ~14\u00b0C in the Northwestern part of the basin to ~23\u00b0C in the Southeastern areas. Large-scale temperature variations in the upper layers are mainly related to the heat exchange with the atmosphere and surrounding oceanic regions. The Mediterranean Sea annual 99th percentile presents a significant interannual and multidecadal variability with a significant increase starting from the 80\u2019s as shown in Marb\u00e0 et al. (2015) which is also in good agreement with the multidecadal change of the mean SST reported in Mariotti et al. (2012). Moreover the spatial variability of the SST 99th percentile shows large differences at regional scale (Darmariaki et al., 2019; Pastor et al. 2018).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Mediterranean mean Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile evaluated in the period 1987-2019 (upper panel) presents highest values (~ 28-30 \u00b0C) in the eastern Mediterranean-Levantine basin and along the Tunisian coasts especially in the area of the Gulf of Gabes, while the lowest (~ 23\u201325 \u00b0C) are found in the Gulf of Lyon (a deep water formation area), in the Alboran Sea (affected by incoming Atlantic waters) and the eastern part of the Aegean Sea (an upwelling region). These results are in agreement with previous findings in Darmariaki et al. (2019) and Pastor et al. (2018) and are consistent with the ones presented in CMEMS OSR3 (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019) for the period 1993-2016.\nThe 2020      Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile anomaly map (bottom panel) shows a general positive pattern up to +3\u00b0C in the North-West Mediterranean area while colder anomalies are visible in the Gulf of Lion      and North Aegean Sea     . This Ocean Monitoring Indicator confirms the continuous warming of the SST and in particular it shows that the year 2020      is characterized by an overall increase of the extreme Sea Surface Temperature values in almost the whole domain with respect to the reference period. This finding can be probably affected      by the different dataset used to evaluate this anomaly map: the 2020      Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile derived from the Near Real Time Analysis product compared to the mean (1987-2019) Sea Surface Temperature 99th percentile evaluated from the      Reanalysis product which, among the others, is characterized by different atmospheric forcing).\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00266\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

Anomalies are computed against the 1991-2020 reference period. The 30-year climatology 1991-2020 is defined according to the WMO recommendation (WMO, 2017) and recent U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration practice (https://wmo.int/media/news/updated-30-year-reference-period-reflects-changing-climate). The reference for this OMI can be found in the first and second issue of the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Report (OSR), Section 1.1 (Roquet et al., 2016; Mulet et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is a key climate variable since it deeply contributes in regulating climate and its variability (Deser et al., 2010). SST is then essential to monitor and characterise the state of the global climate system (GCOS 2010). Long-term SST variability, from interannual to (multi-)decadal timescales, provides insight into the slow variations/changes in SST, i.e. the temperature trend (e.g., Pezzulli et al., 2005). In addition, on shorter timescales, SST anomalies become an essential indicator for extreme events, as e.g. marine heatwaves (Hobday et al., 2018). The Mediterranean Sea is a climate change hotspot (Giorgi F., 2006). Indeed, Mediterranean SST has experienced a continuous warming trend since the beginning of 1980s (e.g., Pisano et al., 2020; Pastor et al., 2020). Specifically, since the beginning of the 21st century (from 2000 onward), the Mediterranean Sea featured the highest SSTs and this warming trend is expected to continue throughout the 21st century (Kirtman et al., 2013). \n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nDuring 2023, the Mediterranean Sea continued experiencing the intense sea surface temperatures\u2019 warming (marine heatwave event) that started in May 2022 (Marullo et al., 2023). The basin average SST anomaly was 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C in 2023, the highest in this record. The Mediterranean SST warming started in May 2022, when the mean anomaly increased abruptly from 0.01 \u00b0C (April) to 0.76 \u00b0C (May), reaching the highest values during June (1.66 \u00b0C) and July (1.52 \u00b0C), and persisting until summer 2023 with anomalies around 1 \u00b0C above the 1991-2020 climatology. The peak of July 2023 (1.76 \u00b0C) set the record of highest SST anomaly ever recorded since 1982. The 2022/2023 Mediterranean marine heatwave is comparable to that occurred in 2003 (see e.g. Olita et al., 2007) in terms of anomaly magnitude but longer in duration.\nOver the period 1982-2023, the Mediterranean SST has warmed at a rate of 0.041 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b0C/year, which corresponds to an average increase of about 1.7 \u00b0C during these last 42 years. Within its error (namely, the 95% confidence interval), this warming trend is consistent with recent trend estimates in the Mediterranean Sea (Pisano et al., 2020; Pastor et al., 2020). However, though the linear trend being constantly increasing during the whole period, the picture of the Mediterranean SST trend in 2022 seems to reveal a restarting after the pause occurred in the last years (since 2015-2021).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00268\n\n**References:**\n\n* Giorgi, F., 2006.

The spatial pattern of the Mediterranean SST trend shows a general warming tendency, ranging from 0.002 \u00b0C/year to 0.063 \u00b0C/year. Overall, a higher SST trend intensity characterizes the Eastern and Central Mediterranean basin with respect to the Western basin. In particular, the Balearic Sea, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas, as well as the northern Ionian and Aegean-Levantine Seas show the highest SST trends (from 0.04 \u00b0C/year to 0.05 \u00b0C/year on average). Trend patterns of warmer intensity characterize some of main sub-basin Mediterranean features, such as the Pelops Anticyclone, the Cretan gyre and the Rhodes Gyre. On the contrary, less intense values characterize the southern Mediterranean Sea (toward the African coast), where the trend attains around 0.025 \u00b0C/year. The SST warming rate spatial change, mostly showing an eastward increase pattern (see, e.g., Pisano et al., 2020, and references therein), i.e. the Levantine basin getting warm faster than the Western, appears now to have tilted more along a North-South direction.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00269\n\n**References:**\n\n* Deser, C., Alexander, M.

Two different CMEMS products are used to compute the indicator: The North-West Shelf Multi Year Product (NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009) and the Analysis product (NORTHWESTSHELF_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_004_013).\nTwo parameters are included on this OMI:\n* Map of the 99th mean percentile: It is obtained from the Multi Year Product, the annual 99th percentile is computed for each year of the product. The percentiles are temporally averaged over the whole period (1993-2019).\n* Anomaly of the 99th percentile in 2020: The 99th percentile of the year 2020 is computed from the Analysis product. The anomaly is obtained by subtracting the mean percentile from the 2020 percentile.\nThis indicator is aimed at monitoring the extremes of sea surface temperature every year and at checking their variations in space. The use of percentiles instead of annual maxima, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data. This study of extreme variability was first applied to the sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, such as sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018 and Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019). More details and a full scientific evaluation can be found in the CMEMS Ocean State report (Alvarez Fanjul et al., 2019).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThis domain comprises the North West European continental shelf where depths do not exceed 200m and deeper Atlantic waters to the North and West. For these deeper waters, the North-South temperature gradient dominates (Liu and Tanhua, 2021). Temperature over the continental shelf is affected also by the various local currents in this region and by the shallow depth of the water (Elliott et al., 1990). Atmospheric heat waves can warm the whole water column, especially in the southern North Sea, much of which is no more than 30m deep (Holt et al., 2012). Warm summertime water observed in the Norwegian trench is outflow heading North from the Baltic Sea and from the North Sea itself.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe 99th percentile SST product can be considered to represent approximately the warmest 4 days for the sea surface in Summer. Maximum anomalies for 2020 are up to 4oC warmer than the 1993-2019 average in the western approaches, Celtic and Irish Seas, English Channel and the southern North Sea. For the atmosphere, Summer 2020 was exceptionally warm and sunny in southern UK (Kendon et al., 2021), with heatwaves in June and August. Further north in the UK, the atmosphere was closer to long-term average temperatures. Overall, the 99th percentile SST anomalies show a similar pattern, with the exceptional warm anomalies in the south of the domain.\n\nNote: The key findings will be updated annually in November, in line with OMI evolutions.\n\n**DOI (product)**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00273\n\n**References:**\n\n* \u00c1lvarez Fanjul E, Pascual Collar A, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez B, De Alfonso M, Garc\u00eda Sotillo M, Staneva J, Clementi E, Grandi A, Zacharioudaki A, Korres G, Ravdas M, Renshaw R, Tinker J, Raudsepp U, Lagemaa P, Maljutenko I, Geyer G, M\u00fcller M, \u00c7a\u011flar Yumruktepe V.

The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM).

The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) distributes Remote Sensing Reflectances (RRS, expressed in sr-1), Turbidity (TUR, expressed in FNU), Solid Particulate Matter Concentration (SPM, expressed in mg/l), spectral particulate backscattering (BBP, expressed in m-1) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, expressed in \u00b5g/l) for the Sentinel 2/MSI sensor at 100m resolution for a 20km coastal zone. The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.    \n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n**Description of observation methods/instruments:**\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n**Processing information:**\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021).

The index was computed using sea surface current speed averaged over two areas of intense currents based on reanalysis data. The areas are confined between the 200 and 1800 m isobaths in the northern section 33-39E (from the Caucasus coast to the Crimea Peninsula), and in the southern section 31.5-35E (from Sakarya region to near Sinop Peninsula). Thus, three indices were defined: one for the northern section (BSRCIn), for the southern section (BSRCIs) and an average for the entire basin (BSRCI).\nBSRCI=(V \u0305_ann-V \u0305_cl)/V \u0305_cl \nwhere V \u0305 denotes the representative area average, the \u201cann\u201d denotes the annual mean for each individual year in the analysis, and \u201ccl\u201d indicates the long-term mean over the whole period 1993-2020. In general, BSRCI is defined as the relative annual anomaly from the long-term mean speed.  An index close to zero means close to the average conditions a positive index indicates that the Rim current is more intense than average, or negative - if it is less intense than average. In other words, positive BSRCI would mean higher circumpolar speed, enhanced baroclinicity, enhanced dispersion of pollutants, less degree of exchange between open sea and coastal areas, intensification of the heat redistribution, etc.\nThe BSRCI is introduced in the fifth issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2021). The Black Sea Physics Reanalysis (BLKSEA_REANALYSIS_PHYS_007_004) has been used as a data base to build the index. Details on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Black Sea circulation is driven by the regional winds and large freshwater river inflow in the north-western part (including the main European rivers Danube, Dnepr and Dnestr). The major cyclonic gyre encompasses the sea, referred to as Rim current. It is quasi-geostrophic and the Sverdrup balance approximately applies to it. \nThe Rim current position and speed experiences significant interannual variability (Stanev and Peneva, 2002), intensifying in winter due to the dominating severe northeastern winds in the region (Stanev et al., 2000). Consequently, this impacts the vertical stratification, Cold Intermediate Water formation, the biological activity distribution and the coastal mesoscale eddies\u2019 propagation along the current and their evolution. The higher circumpolar speed leads to enhanced dispersion of pollutants, less degree of exchange between open sea and coastal areas, enhanced baroclinicity, intensification of the heat redistribution which is important for the winter freezing in the northern zones (Simonov and Altman, 1991). Fach (2015) finds that the anchovy larval dispersal in the Black Sea is strongly controlled at the basin scale by the Rim Current and locally - by mesoscale eddies. \nSeveral recent studies of the Black Sea pollution claim that the understanding of the Rim Current behavior and how the mesoscale eddies evolve would help to predict the transport of various pollution such as oil spills (Korotenko, 2018) and floating marine litter (Stanev and Ricker, 2019) including microplastic debris (Miladinova et al., 2020) raising a serious environmental concern today. \nTo summarize, the intensity of the Black Sea Rim Current could give valuable integral measure for a great deal of physical and biogeochemical processes manifestation. Thus our objective is to develop a comprehensive index reflecting the annual mean state of the Black Sea general circulation to be used by policy makers and various end users. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Black Sea Rim Current Index is defined as the relative annual anomaly of the long-term mean speed. The BSRCI value characterizes the annual circulation state: a value close to zero would mean close to average conditions, positive value indicates enhanced circulation, and negative value \u2013 weaker circulation than usual. The time-series of the BSRCI suggest that the Black Sea Rim current speed varies within ~30% in the period 1993-2020 with a positive trend of ~0.1 m/s/decade. In the years 2005 and 2014 there is evidently higher mean velocity, and on the opposite end are the years \u20132004, 2013 and 2016. The time series of the BSRCI gives possibility to check the relationship with the wind vorticity and validate the Sverdrup balance hypothesis. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of the Black Sea Rim Current Index (BSRCI) at the north section (BSRCIn), south section (BSRCIs), the average (BSRCI) and its tendency for the period 1993-2020.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00326\n\n**References:**\n\n* Capet, A., A.

The change in the reprocessed version (previously DT-2018) and the extension of the mean value of the EKE (now 27 years, previously 20 years) induce some slight changes not impacting the general variability of the Kuroshio extension (correlation coefficient of 0.988 for the total period, 0.994 for the delayed time period only). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe Kuroshio Extension is an eastward-flowing current in the subtropical western North Pacific after the Kuroshio separates from the coast of Japan at 35\u00b0N, 140\u00b0E. Being the extension of a wind-driven western boundary current, the Kuroshio Extension is characterized by a strong variability and is rich in large-amplitude meanders and energetic eddies (Niiler et al., 2003; Qiu, 2003, 2002). The Kuroshio Extension region has the largest sea surface height variability on sub-annual and decadal time scales in the extratropical North Pacific Ocean (Jayne et al., 2009; Qiu and Chen, 2010, 2005). Prediction and monitoring of the path of the Kuroshio are of huge importance for local economies as the position of the Kuroshio extension strongly determines the regions where phytoplankton and hence fish are located. Unstable (contracted) phase of the Kuroshio enhance the production of Chlorophyll (Lin et al., 2014).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe different states of the Kuroshio extension phase have been presented and validated by (Bessi\u00e8res et al., 2013) and further reported by Dr\u00e9villon et al. (2018) in the Copernicus Ocean State Report #2. Two rather different states of the Kuroshio extension are observed: an \u2018elongated state\u2019 (also called \u2018strong state\u2019) corresponding to a narrow strong steady jet, and a \u2018contracted state\u2019 (also called \u2018weak state\u2019) in which the jet is weaker and more unsteady, spreading on a wider latitudinal band. When the Kuroshio Extension jet is in a contracted (elongated) state, the upstream Kuroshio Extension path tends to become more (less) variable and regional eddy kinetic energy level tends to be higher (lower). In between these two opposite phases, the Kuroshio extension jet has many intermediate states of transition and presents either progressively weakening or strengthening trends. In 2018, the indicator reveals an elongated state followed by a weakening neutral phase since then.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nStandardized Eddy Kinetic Energy over the Kuroshio region (following Bessi\u00e8res et al., 2013) Blue shaded areas correspond to well established strong elongated states periods, while orange shaded areas fit weak contracted states periods. The ocean monitoring indicator is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) completed by DUACS near Real Time (\u201cnrt\u201d) sea level multi-mission gridded products.

It contains 1D (time dimension) maximum MOC data computed from the Black Sea Reanalysis (BLK-REA; BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_007_004) (Ilicak et al., 2022). The MOC is calculated by summing the meridional transport provided by the Copernicus Marine BLK-REA within density bins. The Black Sea MOC indicator represents the maximum MOC value across the basin for a density range between 22.45 and 23.85 kg/m\u00b3, which corresponds approximately to a depth interval of 25 to 80 m. To understand the overturning circulation of the Black Sea, we compute the residual meridional overturning circulation in density space. Residual overturning as a function of latitude (y) and density (\u03c3 \u0305) bins can be computed as follows:\n\u03c8^* (y,\u03c3 \u0305 )=-1/T \u222b_(t_0)^(t_1)\u2592\u222b_(x_B1)^(x_B2)\u2592\u3016\u222b_(-H)^0\u2592H[\u03c3 \u0305-\u03c3(x,y,z,t)] \u00d7\u03bd(x,y,z,t)dzdxdt,\u3017\nwhere H is the Heaviside function and \u03bd is the meridional velocity. We used 100 \u03c3_2  (potential density anomaly with reference pressure of 2000 dbar) density bins to remap the mass flux fields.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe BS meridional overturning circulation (BS-MOC) is a clockwise circulation in the northern part up to 150 m connected to cold intermediate layer (CIL) and an anticlockwise circulation in the southern part that could be connected to the influence of the Mediterranean Water inflow into the BS. In contrast to counterparts observed in the deep Atlantic and Mediterranean overturning circulations, the BS-MOC is characterized by shallowness and relatively low strength. However, its significance lies in its capacity to monitor the dynamics and evolution of the CIL which is crucial for the ventilation of the subsurface BS waters. The monitoring of the BS-MOC evolution from the BLK-REA can support the understanding how the CIL formation is affected due to climate change.  The study of Black Sea MOC is relatively new. For more details, see Ilicak et al., (2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe MOC values show a significant decline from 1994 to 2009, corresponding to the reduction in the CIL during that period. However, after 2010, the MOC in the Black Sea increased from 0.07 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s) to 0.10 Sv. The CIL has nearly disappeared in recent years, as discussed by Stanev et al. (2019) and Lima et al. (2021) based on observational data and reanalysis results. The opposite pattern observed since 2010 suggests that mechanisms other than the CIL may be influencing the Black Sea MOC.\nFor the OMI we have used an updated version of the reanalysis (version E4R1) which has a different spinup compared to the OSR6 (version E3R1).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00349\n\n**References:**\n\n* Ilicak, M., Causio, S., Ciliberti, S., Coppini, G., Lima, L., Aydogdu, A., Azevedo, D., Lecci, R., Cetin, D.

The Eulerian meridional streamfunction is evaluated by integrating meridional velocity daily data first in a vertical direction, then in a meridional direction, and finally averaging over the reanalysis period.\nThe Mediterranean overturning indices are derived for the eastern and western Mediterranean Sea by computing the annual streamfunction in the two areas separated by the Strait of Sicily around 36.5\u00b0N, and then considering the associated maxima. \nIn each case a geographical constraint focused the computation on the main region of interest. For the western index, we focused on deep-water formation regions, thus excluding both the effect of shallow physical processes and the Gibraltar net inflow. For the eastern index, we investigate the Levantine and Cretan areas corresponding to the strongest meridional overturning cell locations, thus only a zonal constraint is defined.\nTime series of annual mean values is provided for the Mediterranean Sea using the Mediterranean 1/24o eddy resolving reanalysis (Escudier et al., 2020, 2021).\nMore details can be found in the Copernicus Marine Ocean State Report issue 4 (OSR4, von Schuckmann et al., 2020) Section 2.4 (Lyubartsev et al., 2020).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe western and eastern Mediterranean clockwise meridional overturning circulation is connected to deep-water formation processes. The Mediterranean Sea 1/24o eddy resolving reanalysis (Escudier et al., 2020, 2021) is used to show the interannual variability of the Meridional Overturning Index. Details on the product are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI. \nThe Mediterranean Meridional Overturning Index is defined here as the maxima of the clockwise cells in the eastern and western Mediterranean Sea and is associated with deep and intermediate water mass formation processes that occur in specific areas of the basin: Gulf of Lion, Southern Adriatic Sea, Cretan Sea and Rhodes Gyre (Pinardi et al., 2015).\nAs in the global ocean, the overturning circulation of the western and eastern Mediterranean are paramount to determine the stratification of the basins (Cessi, 2019). In turn, the stratification and deep water formation mediate the exchange of oxygen and other tracers between the surface and the deep ocean (e.g., Johnson et al., 2009; Yoon et al., 2018). In this sense, the overturning indices are potential gauges of the ecosystem health of the Mediterranean Sea, and in particular they could instruct early warning indices for the Mediterranean Sea to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 Target 13.3.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe western and eastern Mediterranean overturning indices (WMOI and EMOI) are synthetic indices of changes in the thermohaline properties of the Mediterranean basin related to changes in the main drivers of the basin scale circulation. The western sub-basin clockwise overturning circulation is associated with the deep-water formation area of the Gulf of Lion, while the eastern clockwise meridional overturning circulation is composed of multiple cells associated with different intermediate and deep-water sources in the Levantine, Aegean, and Adriatic Seas. \nOn average, the EMOI shows higher values than the WMOI indicating a more vigorous overturning circulation in eastern Mediterranean. The difference is mostly related to the occurrence of the eastern Mediterranean transient (EMT) climatic event, and linked to a peak of the EMOI in 1992. In 1999, the difference between the two indices started to decrease because EMT water masses reached the Sicily Strait flowing into the western Mediterranean Sea (Schroeder et al., 2016). The western peak in 2006 is discussed to be linked to anomalous deep-water formation during the Western Mediterranean Transition (Smith, 2008; Schroeder et al., 2016). Thus, the WMOI and EMOI indices are a useful tool for long-term climate monitoring of overturning changes in the Mediterranean Sea. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of Mediterranean overturning indices [Sverdrup] calculated from the annual average of the meridional streamfunction over the period 1987 to 2021.

(2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe poleward flow of relatively warm and saline Atlantic Water through the Nordic Seas to the Arctic Basin, balanced by the overflow waters exiting the Nordic Seas, governs the exchanges between the North Atlantic and the Arctic as well as the distribution of oceanic heat within the Arctic (e.g., Mauritzen et al., 2011; Rudels, 2012). Atlantic Water transported poleward has been found to significantly influence the sea-ice cover in the Barents Sea (Sand\u00f8 et al., 2010; \u00c5rthun et al., 2012; Onarheim et al., 2015) and near Svalbard (Piechura and Walczowski, 2009). Furthermore, Atlantic Water flow through the eastern Nordic seas and its associated heat loss and densification are important factors for the formation of overflow waters in the region (Mauritzen, 1996; Eldevik et al., 2009). These overflow waters together with those generated in the Arctic, exit the Greenland Scotland Ridge, which further contribute to the North Atlantic Deep Water (Dickson and Brown, 1994) and thus play an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Eldevik et al., 2009; Ch. 2.3 in von Schuckmann et al., 2016). In addition to the transport of heat, the Atlantic Water also transports nutrients and zooplankton (e.g., Sundby, 2000), and it carries large amounts of ichthyoplankton of commercially important species, such as Arcto-Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua) and Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) along the Norwegian coast. The Atlantic Water flow thus plays an integral part in defining both the physical and biological border between the boreal and Arctic realm. Variability of Atlantic Water flow to the Barents Sea has been found to move the position of the ice edge (Onarheim et al., 2015) as well as habitats of various species in the Barents Sea ecosystem (Fossheim et al., 2015).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe flow of Atlantic Water through the F\u00e6r\u00f8y-Shetland Channel amounts to 2.7 Sv (Berx et al., 2013). The corresponding model-based estimate was 2.5 Sv for the period 1993-2021. \nIn the Barents Sea Opening, the model indicates a long-term average net Atlantic Water inflow of 2.2 Sv, as compared with the long-term estimate from observations of 1.8 Sv (Smedsrud et al., 2013).\nIn the Fram Strait, the model data indicates a positive trend in the Atlantic Water transport to the Arctic. This trend may be explained by increased temperature in the West Spitsbergen Current during the period 2005-2010 (e.g., Walczowski et al., 2012), which caused a larger fraction of the water mass to be characterized as Atlantic Water (T > 2 \u00b0C).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00189\n\n**References:**\n\n* Berx B.

These sections have been chosen to be representative of the temporal variability of various ocean currents within the IBI domain.\nThe currents that are monitored include: transport towards the North Sea through Rockall Trough (RTE) (Holliday et al., 2008; Lozier and Stewart, 2008), Canary Current (CC) (Knoll et al. 2002, Mason et al. 2011), Azores Current (AC) (Mason et al., 2011), Algerian Current (ALG) (Tintor\u00e9 et al, 1988; Benzohra and Millot, 1995; Font et al., 1998), and net transport along the 48\u00baN latitude parallel (N48) (see OMI Figure).\nTo provide ensemble-based results, four Copernicus products have been used. Among these products are three reanalysis products (GLO-REA, IBI-REA and MED-REA) and one product obtained from reprocessed observations (GLO-ARM).\n\u2022\tGLO-REA: GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 (Reanalysis)\n\u2022\tIBI-REA: IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002 (Reanalysis)\n\u2022\tMED-REA: MULTIOBS_GLO_PHY_TSUV_3D_MYNRT_015_012 (Reprocessed observations)\n\u2022\tMED-REA: MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004 (Reanalysis)\nThe time series comprises the ensemble mean (blue line), the ensemble spread (grey shaded area), and the mean transport with the sign reversed (red dashed line) to indicate the threshold of anomaly values that would entail a reversal of the current transport. Additionally, the analysis of trends in the time series at the 95% confidence interval is included in the bottom right corner of each diagram.\nDetails on the product are given in the corresponding Product User Manual (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2024a) and QUality Information Document (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2024b) as well as the CMEMS Ocean State Report: de Pascual-Collar et al., 2024c.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nThe IBI area is a very complex region characterized by a remarkable variety of ocean currents. Among them, Podemos destacar las que se originan como resultado del closure of the North Atlantic Drift (Mason et al., 2011; Holliday et al., 2008; Peliz et al., 2007; Bower et al., 2002; Knoll et al., 2002; P\u00e9rez et al., 2001; Jia, 2000), las corrientes subsuperficiales que fluyen hacia el norte a lo largo del talud continental (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2019; Pascual et al., 2018; Machin et al., 2010; Fricourt et al., 2007; Knoll et al., 2002; Maz\u00e9 et al., 1997; White & Bowyer, 1997). Y las corrientes de intercambio que se producen en el Estrecho de Gibraltar y el Mar de Alboran (Sotillo et al., 2016; Font et al., 1998; Benzohra and Millot, 1995; Tintor\u00e9 et al., 1988).\nThe variability of ocean currents in the IBI domain is relevant to the global thermohaline circulation and other climatic and environmental issues. For example, as discussed by Fasullo and Trenberth (2008), subtropical gyres play a crucial role in the meridional energy balance. The poleward salt transport of Mediterranean water, driven by subsurface slope currents, has significant implications for salinity anomalies in the Rockall Trough and the Nordic Seas, as studied by Holliday (2003), Holliday et al. (2008), and Bozec et al. (2011). The Algerian current serves as the sole pathway for Atlantic Water to reach the Western Mediterranean.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe volume transport time series show periods in which the different monitored currents exhibited significantly high or low variability. In this regard, we can mention the periods 1997-1998 and 2014-2015 for the RTE current, the period 2012-2014 in the N48 section, the years 2006 and 2017 for the ALG current, the year 2021 for the AC current, and the period 2009-2012 for the CC current.\nAdditionally, periods are detected where the anomalies are large enough (in absolute value) to indicate a reversal of the net transport of the current. This is the case for the years 1999, 2003, and 2012-2014 in the N48 section (with a net transport towards the north), the year 2017 in the ALC current (with net transport towards the west), and the year 2010 in the CC current (with net transport towards the north).\nThe trend analysis of the monitored currents does not detect any significant trends over the analyzed period (1993-2022). However, the confidence interval for the trend in the RTE section is on the verge of rejecting the hypothesis of no trend.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nAnnual anomalies of cross-section volume transport in monitoring sections RTE, N48, AC, ALC, and CC. Time series computed and averaged from different Copernicus Marine products for each window (see section Definition) providing a multi-product result. The blue line represents the ensemble mean, and shaded grey areas represent the standard deviation of the ensemble. Red dashed lines depict the velocity value at which the direction of the current reverses. This aligns with the average transport value (with sign reversed) and the point where absolute transport becomes zero. The analysis of trends (at 95% confidence interval) computed in the period 1993\u20132021 is included (bottom right box). Trend lines (gray dashed line) are only included in the figures when a significant trend is obtained.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00351\n\n**References:**\n\n* Benzohra, M., Millot, C.: Characteristics and circulation of the surface and intermediate water masses off Algeria.

(2007)\nOFC =    \u03c1(Sref, Tref, p) / \u03c1(0, Tref, p ) \u00b7 ( Sref - S) / Sref\nwhere S(x, y, z, t) and Sref (x, y, z) are actual salinity and reference salinity, respectively, and x,y,z,t are zonal, meridional, vertical and temporal coordinates, respectively. The density, \u03c1, is calculated according to the TEOS10 (IOC et al., 2010). The key issue of OFC calculations lies in how the reference salinity is defined. The climatological range of salinity in the Baltic Sea varies from the freshwater conditions in the northern and eastern parts to the oceanic water conditions in the Kattegat. We follow the Boyer et al. (2007) formulation and calculate the climatological OFC from the three-dimensional temperature (Tref) and salinity (Sref) fields averaged over the period of 1993\u20132014.\nThe method for calculating the ocean freshwater content anomaly is based on the daily mean sea water salinity fields (S) derived from the Baltic Sea reanalysis product BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011. The total freshwater content anomaly is determined using the following formula:\nOFC(t) = \u222dV OFC(x, y, z, t) dx dy dz\nThe vertical integral is computed using the static cell vertical thicknesses (dz) sourced from the reanalysis product BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011 dataset cmems_mod_bal_phy_my_static, spanning from the sea surface to the 300 m depth. Spatial integration is performed over the Baltic Sea spatial domain, defined as the region between 9\u00b0 - 31\u00b0 E and 53\u00b0 - 66\u00b0 N using product grid definition in cmems_mod_bal_phy_my_static. \nWe evaluate the uncertainty from the mean standard deviation of monthly mean OFC. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the annual standard deviation of monthly mean OFC. \nLinear trend (km3y-1) has been estimated from the annual anomalies with the uncertainty of 1.96-times standard error.\n\n**CONTEXT**\nClimate warming has resulted in the intensification of the global hydrological cycle but not necessarily on the regional scale (Pratap and Markonis, 2022). The increase of net precipitation over land and sea areas, decrease of ice cover, and increase of river runoff are the main components of the global hydrological cycle that increase freshwater content in the ocean (Boyer et al., 2007) and decrease ocean salinity.\nThe Baltic Sea is one of the marginal seas where water salinity and OFC are strongly influenced by the water exchange with the North Sea. The Major Baltic Inflows (MBIs) are the most voluminous event-type sources of saline water to the Baltic Sea (Mohrholz, 2018). The frequency and intensity of the MBIs and other large volume inflows have no long-term trends but do have a multidecadal variability of about 30 years (Mohrholz, 2018; Lehmann and Post, 2015; Lehmann et al., 2017; Radtke et al., 2020). Smaller barotropic and baroclinically driven inflows transport saline water into the halocline or below it, depending on the density of the inflow water (Reissmann et al., 2009). \n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Baltic Sea's ocean freshwater content is exhibiting a declining trend of -37\u00b18.8 km\u00b3/year, along with decadal fluctuations as also noted by Lehmann et al. (2022). Elevated freshwater levels were recorded prior to the Major Baltic Inflows of 1993, 2002, and 2013, which subsequently led to a swift decrease in freshwater content. The lowest ocean freshwater content was recorded in 2019. Over the past four years, the freshwater content anomaly has remained comparatively stable. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00347\n\n**References:**\n\n* Boyer, T., Levitus, S., Antonov, J., Locarnini, R., Mishonov, A., Garcia, H., Josey, S.A., 2007.

The Azov and Marmara Seas are not considered.\nThe quality evaluation of OMI_CLIMATE_OHC_BLKSEA_area_averaged_anomalies is based on the \u201cmulti-product\u201d approach as introduced in the second issue of the Ocean State Report (von Schuckmann et al., 2018), and following the MyOcean\u2019s experience (Masina et al., 2017). Three global products and one regional (Black Sea) product have been used to build an ensemble mean, and its associated ensemble spread. Details on the products are delivered in the PUM and QUID of this OMI.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nKnowing how much and where heat energy is stored and released in the ocean is essential for understanding the contemporary Earth system state, variability and change, as the oceans shape our perspectives for the future.\nSeveral studies discuss a warming in the Black Sea using either observations or model results (Akpinar et al., 2017; Stanev et al. 2019; Lima et al. 2020). Using satellite sea surface temperature observations (SST), Degtyarev (2000) detected a positive temperature trend of 0.016 \u00baC years-1 in the 50-100 m layer from 1985 to 1997. From Argo floats Stanev et al. (2019) found a warming trend in the cold intermediate layer (CIL; at approximately 25 \u2013 70 m) of about 0.05 oC year-1 in recent years. The warming signal was also present in ocean heat content analyses conducted by Lima et al. (2020). Their results from the Black Sea regional reanalysis showed an increase rate of 0.880\u00b10.181 W m-2 in the upper layers (0 \u2013 200 m), which has been reflected in the disappearance of Black Sea cold intermediate layer in recent years. The newest version of reanalysis also presents a warming of 0.814\u00b10.045 W m-2 in 0 \u2013 200 m (Lima et al. (2021). This warming has been reflected in a more incidence of marine heat waves in the Black Sea over the past few years (Mohammed et al. 2022).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nTime series of ocean heat content anomalies present a significant interannual variability, altering between cool and warm events. This important characteristic becomes evident over the years 2012 to 2015: a minimum of ocean heat content anomaly is registered close to \u2013 2.00 x 108 J m-2 in 2012, followed by positive values around 2.00 x 108 J m-2 in 2013 and above 2.0 x 108 J m-2 most of time in 2014 and 2015. Since 2005 the Black Sea experienced an increase in ocean heat content (0-300 m), and record OHC values are noticed in 2020. The Black Sea is warming at a rate of 0.995\u00b10.084 W m-2, which is higher than the global average warming rate.\nThe increase in ocean heat content weakens the CIL, whereas its decreasing favours the CIL restoration (Akpinar et al., 2017). The years 2012 and 2017 exhibited a more evident warming interruption that induced a replenishment of the CIL (Lima et al. 2021).\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of the ensemble mean and ensemble spread (shaded area) of the monthly Black Sea averaged ocean heat content anomalies integrated over the 0-300m depth layer (J m\u20132) during Jan 2005 \u2013 December 2020. The monthly ocean heat content anomalies are defined as the deviation from the climatological ocean heat content mean (1993\u20132014) of each corresponding month. Mean trend values are also reported at the bottom right corner. The ensemble is based on different data products, i.e. Black Sea Reanalysis, global ocean reanalysis GLORYS12V1; global observational based products CORA5.2, ARMOR3D.

Additionally, OHC is one of the six Global Climate Indicators recommended by the World Meterological Organisation (WMO, 2017). \nIn the last decades, the upper North Atlantic Ocean experienced a reversal of climatic trends for temperature and salinity. While the period 1990-2004 is characterized by decadal-scale ocean warming, the period 2005-2014 shows a substantial cooling and freshening. Such variations are discussed to be linked to ocean internal dynamics, and air-sea interactions (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2019; Robson et al 2016). Together with changes linked to the connectivity between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea (Masina et al., 2022), these variations affect the temporal evolution of regional ocean heat content in the IBI region.\nRecent studies (de Pascual-Collar et al., 2023) highlight the key role that subsurface water masses play in the OHC trends in the IBI region. These studies conclude that the vertically integrated trend is the result of different trends (both positive and negative) contributing at different layers. Therefore, the lack of representativeness of the OHC trends in the surface-intermediate waters (from 0 to 1000 m) causes the trends in intermediate and deep waters (from 1000 m to 2000 m) to be masked when they are calculated by integrating the upper layers of the ocean (from surface down to 2000 m).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe ensemble mean OHC anomaly time series over the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region are dominated by strong year-to-year variations, and an ocean warming trend of 0.41\u00b10.4 W/m2 is barely significant.\n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of annual mean area averaged ocean heat content in the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland region (basin wide) and integrated over the 0-2000m depth layer during 1993-2022: ensemble mean (blue line) and ensemble spread (shaded area).

Evolution of the salt content may have an impact in the ocean circulation and dynamics which possibly will have implication on the entire Earth climate system.

At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nThe Baltic Sea is a relatively small semi-enclosed basin with shallow bathymetry. Different forcings have been discussed to trigger sea level variations in the Baltic Sea at different time scales. In addition to steric effects, decadal and longer sea level variability in the basin can be induced by sea water exchange with the North Sea, and in response to atmospheric forcing and climate variability (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation; Gr\u00e4we et al., 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Baltic Sea rises at a rate of 4.1 \uf0b1 0.8 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.10 \uf0b1\uf0200.07 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00202\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the Global Ocean weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and global GIA correction of -0.3mm/yr (common global GIA correction, see Spada, 2017). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.\nThe trend uncertainty of 0.3 mm/yr is provided at 90% confidence interval using altimeter error budget (Gu\u00e9rou et al., 2022). This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation depending on the period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers(WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). According to the recent IPCC 6th assessment report (IPCC WGI, 2021), global mean sea level (GMSL) increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901 to 2018 with a rate of rise that has accelerated since the 1960s to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm/yr for the period 2006\u20132018. Human activity was very likely the main driver of observed GMSL rise since 1970 (IPCC WGII, 2021). The weight of the different contributions evolves with time and in the recent decades the mass change has increased, contributing to the on-going acceleration of the GMSL trend (IPCC, 2022a; Legeais et al., 2020; Horwath et al., 2022). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022b). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022c).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, global mean sea level  rises at a rate of 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 mm/year. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the Topex-A drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and global GIA correction (Spada, 2017) to consider the ongoing movement of land. The observed global trend agrees with other recent estimates (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; IPCC WGI, 2021). About 30% of this rise can be attributed to ocean thermal expansion (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; von Schuckmann et al., 2018), 60% is due to land ice melt from glaciers and from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. The remaining 10% is attributed to changes in land water storage, such as soil moisture, surface water and groundwater. From year to year, the global mean sea level record shows significant variations related mainly to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00237\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously, and regional sea level change is also influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2019, 2022b). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022c). \n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe altimeter sea level trends over the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period exhibit large-scale variations with trends up to +10 mm/yr in regions such as the western tropical Pacific Ocean. In this area, trends are mainly of thermosteric origin (Legeais et al., 2018; Meyssignac et al., 2017) in response to increased easterly winds during the last two decades associated with the decreasing Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)/Pacific Decadal Oscillation (e.g., McGregor et al., 2012; Merrifield et al., 2012; Palanisamy et al., 2015; Rietbroek et al., 2016).\nPrandi et al. (2021) have estimated a regional altimeter sea level error budget from which they determine a regional error variance-covariance matrix and they provide uncertainties of the regional sea level trends. Over 1993-2019, the averaged local sea level trend uncertainty is around 0.83 mm/yr with local values ranging from 0.78 to 1.22 mm/yr. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00238\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nature Clim Change, 4, 358\u2013361, https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2159, 2014.\n* Horwath, M., Gutknecht, B.

At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nIn IBI region, the RMSL trend is modulated by decadal variations. As observed over the global ocean, the main actors of the long-term RMSL trend are associated with anthropogenic global/regional warming. Decadal variability is mainly linked to the strengthening or weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (e.g. Chafik et al., 2019). The latest is driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)  for decadal (20-30y) timescales (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016). Along the European coast, the NAO also influences the along-slope winds dynamic which in return significantly contributes to the local sea level variability observed (Chafik et al., 2019).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the IBI area rises at a rate of 4.00 \uf0b1 0.80 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.14 \uf0b1\uf0200.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the Topex-A drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and global GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00252\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \nBeside a clear long-term trend, the regional mean sea level variation in the Mediterranean Sea shows an important interannual variability, with a high trend observed between 1993 and 1999 (nearly 8.4 mm/y) and relatively lower values afterward (nearly 2.4 mm/y between 2000 and 2022). This variability is associated with a variation of the different forcing. Steric effect has been the most important forcing before 1999 (Fenoglio-Marc, 2002; Vigo et al., 2005). Important change of the deep-water formation site also occurred in the 90\u2019s. Their influence contributed to change the temperature and salinity property of the intermediate and deep water masses. These changes in the water masses and distribution is also associated with sea surface circulation changes, as the one observed in the Ionian Sea in 1997-1998 (e.g. Ga\u010di\u0107 et al., 2011), under the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases (Incarbona et al., 2016). These circulation changes may also impact the sea level trend in the basin (Vigo et al., 2005). In 2010-2011, high regional mean sea level has been related to enhanced water mass exchange at Gibraltar, under the influence of wind forcing during the negative phase of NAO (Landerer and Volkov, 2013).The relatively high contribution of both sterodynamic (due to steric and circulation changes) and gravitational, rotational, and deformation (due to mass and water storage changes) after 2000 compared to the [1960, 1989] period is also underlined by (Calafat et al., 2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the Mediterranean Sea rises at a rate of 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.01 \u00b1 0.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the global Topex-A instrumental drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and regional GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00264\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

The latest is driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for decadal (20-30y) timescales (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016). Along the European coast, the NAO also influences the along-slope winds dynamic which in return significantly contributes to the local sea level variability observed (Chafik et al., 2019).

The ocean monitoring indicator is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) altimeter sea level gridded products distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and by the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057). The annual and semi-annual periodic signals are removed, the timeseries is low-pass filtered (175 days cut-off), and the curve is corrected for the GIA using the ICE5G-VM2 GIA model (Peltier, 2004).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00271\n\n**References:**\n\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

The Baltic Sea is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST records and the assessment of climatic variability (H\u00f8yer and She 2007; H\u00f8yer and Karagali 2016). The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed basin with natural variability and it is influenced by large-scale atmospheric processes and by the vicinity of land. In addition, the Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world. When analysing regional-scale climate variability, all these effects have to be considered, which requires dedicated regional and validated SST products. Satellite observations have previously been used to analyse the climatic SST signals in the North Sea and Baltic Sea (BACC II Author Team 2015; Lehmann et al. 2011). Recently, H\u00f8yer and Karagali (2016) demonstrated that the Baltic Sea had warmed 1-2 oC from 1982 to 2012 considering all months of the year and 3-5 oC when only July-September months were considered. This was corroborated in the Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018). \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe basin-average trend of SST anomalies for Baltic Sea region amounts to 0.038\u00b10.004\u00b0C/year over the period 1982-2023 which corresponds to an average warming of 1.60\u00b0C. Adding the North Sea area, the average trend amounts to 0.029\u00b10.002\u00b0C/year over the same period, which corresponds to an average warming of 1.22\u00b0C for the entire region since 1982. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nTime series of monthly mean (turquoise line) and annual mean (blue line) of sea surface temperature anomalies for January 1982 to December 2023, relative to the 1991-2020 mean, combined for the Baltic Sea and North Sea SST  (OMI_CLIMATE_SST_BAL_area_averaged_anomalies).

The annual mean surface temperature anomaly is calculated from the climatological mean estimated from 1991 to 2020, defined according to the WMO recommendation (WMO, 2017) and recent U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration practice (https://wmo.int/media/news/updated-30-year-reference-period-reflects-changing-climate,). The SST/IST Level 4 analysis that provides the input to the climatology and mean anomaly calculations are taken from the reprocessed product SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 with a recent update to include 2023. The product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees in latitude and longitude. \nThe OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1982 to December 31, 2023 and is constructed by calculating monthly average anomalies from the reference climatology from 1991 to 2020, using the daily level 4 SST analysis fields of the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 product. See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018) for more information on the temperature OMI product. The times series of monthly anomalies have been used to calculate the trend in surface temperature (combined SST and IST) using Sen\u2019s method with confidence intervals from the Mann-Kendall test (section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSST and IST are essential climate variables that act as important input for initializing numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and monitoring climate change. Especially in the Arctic, SST/IST feedbacks amplify climate change (AMAP, 2021). In the Arctic Ocean, the surface temperatures play a crucial role for the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, sea ice growth and melt processes (Key et al, 1997) in addition to weather and sea ice forecasts through assimilation into ocean and atmospheric models (Rasmussen et al., 2018). \nThe Arctic Ocean is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST and IST records and the assessment of climatic variability due to the presence of both seawater and ice, and the large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the sea ice cover which lead to increased complexity in the SST mapping of the Arctic region. Combining SST and ice surface temperature (IST) is identified as the most appropriate method for determining the surface temperature of the Arctic (Minnett et al., 2020).  \nPreviously, climate trends have been estimated individually for SST and IST records (Bulgin et al., 2020; Comiso and Hall, 2014). However, this is problematic in the Arctic region due to the large temporal variability in the sea ice cover including the overlying northward migration of the ice edge on decadal timescales, and thus, the resulting climate trends are not easy to interpret (Comiso, 2003). A combined surface temperature dataset of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone (MIZ) provides a consistent climate indicator, which is important for studying climate trends in the Arctic region.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe area average anomaly of 2023 is 1.70\u00b11.08\u00b0C (\u00b1 means 1 standard deviation in this case). The majority of anomalies are positive and exceed 2\u00b0C for most areas of the Arctic Ocean, while the largest regional anomalies exceeded 6\u00b0C. Near zero and slightly negative anomalies are observed in some areas of the Barents, Norwegian and Greenland Sea and around the Bering Strait. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00353\n\n**References:**\n\n* AMAP, 2021.

The cumulative trend is the rate of change (\u00b0C/year) scaled by the number of years (42 years). The SST/IST Level 4 analysis that provides the input to the trend calculations are taken from the reprocessed product SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 with a recent update to include 2023. The product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees in latitude and longitude.\n\nThe OMI time series runs from Jan 1, 1982 to December 31, 2023 and is constructed by calculating monthly averages  from the reference climatology defined over the period 1991-2020, according to the WMO recommendation (WMO, 2017) and recent U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration practice (https://wmo.int/media/news/updated-30-year-reference-period-reflects-changing-climate), using daily level 4 SST/IST analysis fields of the SEAICE_ARC_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_011_016 product. See the Copernicus Marine Service Ocean State Reports (section 1.1 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2016; section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018) for more information on the temperature OMI product. The times series of monthly anomalies have been used to calculate the trend in surface temperature (combined SST and IST) using Sen\u2019s method with confidence intervals from the Mann-Kendall test (section 3 in Von Schuckmann et al., 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSST and IST are essential climate variables that act as important input for initializing numerical weather prediction models and fundamental for understanding air-sea interactions and monitoring climate change. Especially in the Arctic, SST/IST feedbacks amplify climate change (AMAP, 2021). In the Arctic Ocean, the surface temperatures play a crucial role for the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, sea ice growth and melt processes (Key et al., 1997) in addition to weather and sea ice forecasts through assimilation into ocean and atmospheric models (Rasmussen et al., 2018). \nThe Arctic Ocean is a region that requires special attention regarding the use of satellite SST and IST records and the assessment of climatic variability due to the presence of both seawater and ice, and the large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the sea ice cover which lead to increased complexity in the SST mapping of the Arctic region. Combining SST and ice surface temperature (IST) is identified as the most appropriate method for determining the surface temperature of the Arctic (Minnett et al., 2020).  \nPreviously, climate trends have been estimated individually for SST and IST records (Bulgin et al., 2020; Comiso and Hall, 2014). However, this is problematic in the Arctic region due to the large temporal variability in the sea ice cover including the overlying northward migration of the ice edge on decadal timescales, and thus, the resulting climate trends are not easy to interpret (Comiso, 2003). A combined surface temperature dataset of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone (MIZ) provides a consistent climate indicator, which is important for studying climate trends in the Arctic region.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nSST/IST trends were calculated for the Arctic Ocean over the period January 1982 to December 2023. The cumulative trends are upwards of 2\u00b0C for the greatest part of the Arctic Ocean, with the largest trends occur in the Beaufort Sea, Chuckchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, Kara Sea and parts of Baffin Bay. Zero to slightly negative trends are found at the North Atlantic part of the Arctic Ocean. The combined sea and sea ice surface temperature  trend is 0.104+/-0.005\u00b0C/yr, i.e. an increase by around 4.37\u00b0C between 1982 and 2023. The 2d map of Arctic anomalies reveals regional peak warming exceeding 6\u00b0C.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00324\n\n**References:**\n\n* AMAP, 2021.

(2008) and further reported by Tranchant et al. (2019) in the CMEMS Ocean State Report #3. The NPGO is defined as the second dominant mode of variability of Sea Surface Height (SSH) anomaly and SST anomaly in the Northeast Pacific (25\u00b0\u2013 62\u00b0N, 180\u00b0\u2013 250\u00b0E). The spatial and temporal pattern of the NPGO has been deduced over the [1950-2004] period using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition on sea level and sea surface temperature fields produced by the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008; Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005). Afterward, the sea level spatial pattern of the NPGO is used/projected with satellite altimeter delayed-time sea level anomalies to calculate and update the NPGO index.\nThe NPGO index disseminated on CMEMS was specifically updated from 2004 onward using up-to-date altimeter products (DT2021 version; SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY _008_047 CMEMS product, including \u201cmy\u201d & \u201cmyint\u201d datasets, and the near-real time SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT _008_046 CMEMS product). Users that previously used the index disseminated on www.o3d.org/npgo/ web page will find slight differences induced by this update. The change in the reprocessed version (previously DT-2018) and the extension of the mean value of the SSH anomaly (now 27 years, previously 20 years) induce some slight changes not impacting the general variability of the NPGO.  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nNPGO mode emerges as the leading mode of decadal variability for surface salinity and upper ocean nutrients (Di Lorenzo et al., 2009). The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) term is used because its fluctuations reflect changes in the intensity of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyres circulations (Chhak et al., 2009). This index measures change in the North Pacific gyres circulation and explains key physical-biological ocean variables including temperature, salinity, sea level, nutrients, chlorophyll-a. A positive North Pacific Gyre Oscillation phase is a dipole pattern with negative SSH anomaly north of 40\u00b0N and the opposite south of 40\u00b0N. (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008) suggested that the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation is the oceanic expression of the atmospheric variability of the North Pacific Oscillation (Walker and Bliss, 1932), which has an expression in both the 2nd EOFs of SSH and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies (Ceballos et al., 2009). This finding is further supported by the recent work of (Yi et al., 2018) showing consistent pattern features between the atmospheric North Pacific Oscillation and the oceanic North Pacific Gyre Oscillation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) database.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe NPGO index is presently in a negative phase, associated with a positive SSH anomaly north of 40\u00b0N and negative south of 40\u00b0N. This reflects a reduced amplitude of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyre, corresponding to a reduced coastal upwelling and thus a lower sea surface salinity and concentration of nutrients. \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nNorth Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index monthly averages. The NPGO index has been projected on normalized satellite altimeter sea level anomalies. The NPGO index is derived from (Di Lorenzo et al., 2008) before 2004, the DUACS delayed-time (reprocessed version DT-2021, \u201cmy\u201d (multi-year) dataset used when available, \u201cmyint\u201d (multi-year interim) used after) completed by DUACS near Real Time (\u201cnrt\u201d) sea level multi-mission gridded products. The vertical red lines show the date of the transition between the historical Di Lorenzo\u2019s series and the DUACS product, then between the DUACS \u201cmyint\u201d and \u201cnrt\u201d products used.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00221\n\n**References:**\n\n* Ceballos, L.

The marine heatwave concept and terminology was systemized by Hobday et al. (2016), and a generally adopted definition of a marine heatwave is a period of more than five days where the temperature within a region exceeds the 90th percentile of the seasonally varying climatological average temperature for that region. The Barents Sea region has warmed considerably during the most recent climatological average period (1991-2020) due to a combination of climate warming and positive phase of regional climate variability (e.g., Lind et al., 2018 ; Skagseth et al., 2020 ; Smedsrud et al., 2022), with profound consequences for marine life where boreal species are moving northward at the expense of arctic species (e.g., Fossheim et al., 2015; Oziel et al., 2020;  Husson et al., 2022).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThere is a clear tendency of reduced frequency and intensity of marine cold spells, and a tendency towards increased frequency and intensity of marine heat waves in the Barents Sea. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00346\n\n**References:**\n\n* Fossheim M, Primicerio R, Johannesen E, Ingvaldsen RB, Aschan MM, Dolgov AV. 2015.

This OMI provides time series of seasonal mean and extreme SWH values in three oceanic regions as well as their trends from 2002 to 2020, computed from the reprocessed global L4 SWH product (WAVE_GLO_PHY_SWH_L4_MY_014_007). The extreme SWH is defined as the 95th percentile of the daily maximum of SWH over the chosen period and region. The 95th percentile represents the value below which 95% of the data points fall, indicating higher wave heights than usual. The mean and the 95th percentile of SWH are calculated for two seasons of the year to take into account the seasonal variability of waves (January, February, and March, and July, August, and September) and are in m while the trends are in cm/yr.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nGrasping the nature of global ocean surface waves, their variability, and their long-term interannual shifts is essential for climate research and diverse oceanic and coastal applications. The sixth IPCC Assessment Report underscores the significant role waves play in extreme sea level events (Mentaschi et al., 2017), flooding (Storlazzi et al., 2018), and coastal erosion (Barnard et al., 2017). Additionally, waves impact ocean circulation and mediate interactions between air and sea (Donelan et al., 1997) as well as sea-ice interactions (Thomas et al., 2019). Studying these long-term and interannual changes demands precise time series data spanning several decades. Until now, such records have been available only from global model reanalyses or localised in situ observations. While buoy data are valuable, they offer limited local insights and are especially scarce in the southern hemisphere. In contrast, altimeters deliver global, high-quality measurements of significant wave heights (SWH) (Gommenginger et al., 2002). The growing satellite record of SWH now facilitates more extensive global and long-term analyses. By using SWH data from a multi-mission altimetric product from 2002 to 2020, we can calculate global mean SWH and extreme SWH and evaluate their trends.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOver the period from 2002 to 2020, positive trends in both Significant Wave Height (SWH) and extreme SWH are mostly found in the southern hemisphere. The 95th percentile of wave heights (q95), increases more rapidly than the average values, indicating that extreme waves are growing faster than the average wave height. In the North Atlantic, SWH has increased in summertime (July August September) and decreased during the wintertime: the trend for the 95th percentile SWH is decreasing by 2.1 \u00b1 3.3 cm/year, while the mean SWH shows a decreasing trend of 2.2 \u00b1 1.76 cm/year. In the south of Australia, in boreal winter, the 95th percentile SWH is increasing at a rate of 2.6 \u00b1 1.5 cm/year (a), with the mean SWH increasing by 0.7 \u00b1 0.64 cm/year (b). Finally, in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, also in boreal winter, the 95th percentile SWH trend is 3.2 \u00b1 2.15 cm/year (a) and the mean SWH trend is 1.4 \u00b1 0.82 cm/year (b). This variation highlights that waves evolve differently across different basins and seasons, illustrating the complex and region-specific nature of wave height trends. A full discussion regarding this OMI can be found in A. Laloue et al. (2024).\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00352\n\n**References:**\n\n* Barnard, P.

It is computed for the variable sea level measured by tide gauges along the coast. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The annual percentiles referred to annual mean sea level are temporally averaged and their spatial evolution is displayed in the dataset omi_extreme_sl_baltic_slev_mean_and_anomaly_obs, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).\n\n**CONTEXT**\nSea level (SLEV) is one of the Essential Ocean Variables most affected by climate change. Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990\u2019s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one meter by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020, Tebaldi et al., 2021). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves (Boumis et al., 2023). The increase in extreme sea levels over recent decades is, therefore, primarily due to the rise in mean sea level. Note, however, that the methodology used to compute this OMI removes the annual 50th percentile, thereby discarding the mean sea level trend to isolate changes in storminess.   \nThe Baltic Sea is affected by vertical land motion due to the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (Ludwigsen et al., 2020) and consequently relative sea level trends (as measured by tide gauges) have been shown to be strongly negative, especially in the northern part of the basin. On the other hand, Baltic Sea absolute sea level trends (from altimetry-based observations) show statistically significant positive trends (Passaro et al., 2021).\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\nUp to 45 stations fulfill the completeness index criteria in this region, a few less than in 2020 (51). The spatial variation of the mean 99th percentiles follow the tidal range pattern, reaching its highest values in the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia (e.g.: 0.81 and 0.78 m above mean sea level at the Finnish stations Kemi and Oulu, respectively) and the inner part of the Gulf of Finland (e.g.: 0.83 m above mean sea level in St. Petersburg,  Russia). Smaller tides and therefore 99th percentiles are found along the southeastern coast of Sweden, between Stockholm and Gotland Island (e.g.: 0.42 m above mean sea level in Visby, Gotland Island-Sweden). Annual 99th percentiles standard deviation ranges between 3-5 cm in the South (e.g.: 3 cm in Korsor, Denmark) to 10-13 cm in the Gulf of Finland (e.g.: 12 cm in Hamina).  Negative anomalies of 2022 99th percentile are observed in the northern part of the basin, in the Gulf of Bothnia, in the inner part of the Gulf of Finland and in Lolland Island stations (Denmark) reaching maximum values of -12 cm in Kemi, -9 cm in St. Petersburg and -8 cm in Rodby, respectively.. Positive anomalies of 2022 99th percentile are however found in the central and southeastern parts of the basin, with maximum values reaching 7 cm in Paldisky (Estonia) and Slipshavn (Denmark).  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00203\n\n**References:**\n\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.

This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018). \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea level (SLEV) is one of the Essential Ocean Variables most affected by climate change. Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990\u2019s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one meter by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020, Tebaldi et al., 2021). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves (Boumis et al., 2023). The increase in extreme sea levels over recent decades is, therefore, primarily due to the rise in mean sea level. Note, however, that the methodology used to compute this OMI removes the annual 50th percentile, thereby discarding the mean sea level trend to isolate changes in storminess. \nThe Mediterranean Sea shows statistically significant positive sea level trends over the whole basin. However, at sub-basin scale sea level trends show spatial variability arising from local circulation (Calafat et al., 2022; Meli et al., 2023).\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe completeness index criteria is fulfilled in this region by 38 stations, 26 more than in 2021, significantly increasing spatial coverage with new in situ data in the central Mediterranean Sea, primarily from Italian stations. The mean 99th percentiles reflect the spatial variability of the tide, a microtidal regime, along the Spanish,  French and Italian coasts, ranging from around 0.20 m above mean sea level in Sicily and the Balearic Islands (e.g.: 0.22 m in Porto Empedocle, 0.23 m  in Ibiza)) to around 0.60 m above mean sea level in the Northern Adriatic Sea (e.g.: 0.63 m in Trieste, 0.61 m in Venice). . The annual 99th percentiles standard deviation ranges between 2 cm in M\u00e1laga and Motril (South of Spain) to 8 cm in Marseille. . The 2022 99th percentile anomalies present negative values mainly along the Spanish coast (as in 2021) and in the islands of Corsica and Sardinia (Western part of the region), while positive values are observed along the Eastern French Mediterranean coast and at most of the Italian stations (closer to the central part of the region), with values ranging from -4 cm in M\u00e1laga and Motril (Spain) to +5 cm in Ancona (Italy). \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00265\n\n**References:**\n\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.

In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Baltic Sea has showed in the last two decades a warming trend across the whole basin with more frequent and severe heat waves (IPCC, 2022). This trend is significantly higher when considering only the summer season, which would affect the high extremes (e.g. H\u00f8yer and Karagali, 2016).\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area go from 19.6\u00baC in Tallinn station to 21.4\u00baC in Rohukula station, and the standard deviation ranges between 1\u00baC and 5.4\u00baC reached in the Estonian Coast.\nResults for this year show either positive or negative low anomalies in the Coast of Sweeden (-0.7/+0.5\u00baC) within the standard deviation margin and a general positive anomaly in the rest of the region. This anomaly is noticeable in Rohukula and Virtsu tide gauges (Estonia) with +3.9\u00baC, but inside the standard deviation in both locations. In the South Baltic two stations, GreifswalderOie and Neustadt, reach an anomaly of +2\u00baC, but around the standard deviation.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00204\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The percentiles are temporally averaged, and the spatial evolution is displayed, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez et al 2018).  \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is one of the essential ocean variables affected by climate change (mean SST trends, SST spatial and interannual variability, and extreme events). In Europe, several studies show warming trends in mean SST for the last years (von Schuckmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021, 2022). An exception seems to be the North Atlantic, where, in contrast, anomalous cold conditions have been observed since 2014 (Mulet et al., 2018; Dubois et al. 2018; IPCC 2021, 2022). Extremes may have a stronger direct influence in population dynamics and biodiversity. According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Iberia Biscay Ireland area is characterized by a great complexity in terms of processes that take place in it. The sea surface temperature varies depending on the latitude with higher values to the South. In this area, the clear warming trend observed in other European Seas is not so evident. The northwest part is influenced by the refreshing trend in the North Atlantic, and a mild warming trend has been observed in the last decade (Pisano et al. 2020).\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a range from 16-20\u00baC in the Southwest of the British Isles and the English Channel, 19-21\u00baC in the West of Galician Coast, 21-23\u00baC in the south of Bay of Biscay, 23.5\u00baC in the Gulf of Cadiz to 24.5\u00baC in the Canary Island. The standard deviations are between 0.5\u00baC and 1.3\u00baC in the region except in the English Channel where the standard deviation is higher, reaching 3\u00baC.\nResults for this year show either positive or negative low anomalies below the 45\u00ba parallel, with a slight positive anomaly in the Gulf of Cadiz and the Southeast of the Bay of Biscay over 1\u00baC. In the Southwest of the British Isles and the English Channel, the anomaly is clearly positive, with some stations with an anomaly over 2\u00baC, but inside the standard deviation in the area. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00255\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

According to Alexander et al. 2018 the observed warming trend will continue during the 21st Century and this can result in exceptionally large warm extremes. Monitoring the evolution of sea surface temperature extremes is, therefore, crucial.\nThe Mediterranean Sea has showed a constant increase of the SST in the last three decades across the whole basin with more frequent and severe heat waves (Juza et al., 2022). Deep analyses of the variations have displayed a non-uniform rate in space, being the warming trend more evident in the eastern Mediterranean Sea with respect to the western side. This variation rate is also changing in time over the three decades with differences between the seasons (e.g. Pastor et al. 2018; Pisano et al. 2020), being higher in Spring and Summer, which would affect the extreme values.\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present values from 25\u00baC in Ionian Sea and 26\u00ba in the Alboran sea and Gulf of Lion to 27\u00baC in the East of Iberian Peninsula. The standard deviation ranges from 0.6\u00baC to 1.2\u00baC in the Western Mediterranean and is around 2.2\u00baC in the Ionian Sea.\nResults for this year show a slight negative anomaly in the Ionian Sea (-1\u00baC) inside the standard deviation and a clear positive anomaly in the Western Mediterranean Sea reaching +2.2\u00baC, almost two times the standard deviation in the area.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00267\n\n**References:**\n\n* Alexander MA, Scott JD, Friedland KD, Mills KE, Nye JA, Pershing AJ, Thomas AC. 2018.

These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nIn the Baltic Sea, the particular bathymetry and geography of the basin intensify the seasonal and spatial fluctuations in wave conditions.

These storm events were detected using the method proposed by Weisse and G\u00fcnther (2007). The basis of the method is the definition of a severe event threshold (SET), which we define as the 99th percentile of the significant wave height (SWH). Then, the exceedance and shortfall of the SWH at every grid point was determined and counted as a storm event. The analysis of extreme wave events also comprises the following three parameters but are not part of this OMI. The time period between each exceedance and shortfall of the SET is the lifetime of an event. The difference in the maximum SWH of each event and the SET is defined as the event intensity. The geographic area of storm events and exceedance of the SET are defined as the maximum event area. The number, lifetime, and intensity of events were averaged over each year. Finally, the yearly values were used to compute the long-term means. In addition to these parameters, we estimated the difference (anomaly) of the last available year in the multiyear dataset compared against the long-term average as well as the linear trend. To show multiyear variability, each event, fulfilling the above-described definition, is considered in the statistics. This was done independent of the events\u2019 locations within the domain. To obtain long-term trends, a linear regression was applied to the yearly time series. The statistics are based on the period 1950 to -1Y. This approach has been presented in Staneva et al. (2022) for the area of the Black Sea and was later adapted to the South Atlantic in Gramcianinov et al. (2023a, 2023b).\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nIn the last decade, the European seas have been hit by severe storms, causing serious damage to offshore infrastructure and coastal zones and drawing public attention to the importance of having reliable and comprehensive wave forecasts/hindcasts, especially during extreme events. In addition, human activities such as the offshore wind power industry, the oil industry, and coastal recreation regularly require climate and operational information on maximum wave height at a high resolution in space and time. Thus, there is a broad consensus that a high-quality wave climatology and predictions and a deep understanding of extreme waves caused by storms could substantially contribute to coastal risk management and protection measures, thereby preventing or minimising human and material damage and losses. In this respect and in the frame of climate change, which also affects regional wind patterns and therewith the wave climate, it is important for coastal regions to gain insights into wave extreme characteristics and the related trends. These insights are crucial to initiate necessary abatement strategies especially in combination with extreme wave power statistics (see OMI OMI_EXTREME_WAVE_BLKSEA_wave_power).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe yearly mean number of storm events is rather low in regions where the average annual lifetime and intensity of storms are high. In contrast, the number of events is high where their lifetime and intensity are low. While the southwest Black Sea is exposed to yearly mean storm event numbers of below the long-term spatial averages (7.3 events), it is observed that the yearly mean lifetime of the events in the same region is higher than the long-term averages. The extreme wave statistics based on the 99th percentile threshold of the significant wave height (SWH) are very similar to the wind sea wave parameter, and the swell contribution is much lower. On overall, the yearly trend of the storm events is slightly negative (-0.01 events/year) with two areas showing positive trends located in the very east and west. In terms of the mean number of storm events in 2022, a pronounced area with positive values is located along the eastern coast and another in the western basin. The rest of the Black Sea area mostly experienced less events in 2022.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00348\n\n**References:**\n\n* Gramcianinov, C.B., Staneva, J., de Camargo, R., & da Silva Dias, P.L.

For both reliable estimates of long-term Wave Power extremes are important to secure a high efficiency and to guarantee a robust and secure design, respectively.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe 99th percentile of wave power mean patterns are overall consistent with the respective significant wave height pattern. The maximum 99th percentile of wave power is observed in the southwestern Black Sea. Typical values of in the eastern basin are ~20 kW/m and in the western basin ~45 kW/m. The trend of the 99th percentile of the wave power is decreasing with typical values of 50 W/m/year and a maximum of 120 W/m/year, which is equivalent to a ~25% decrease over whole period with respect to the mean. The pattern of the anomaly of the 99th percentile of wave power in 2022 correlates well with that of the wind speed anomaly in 2022, revealing a negative wave-power anomaly in the western Black Sea (P_2020<P_average) and a mix of positive (P_2020<P_average) and negative anomalies in the eastern basin, where the positive anomalies are mainly present in coastal regions.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00350\n\n**References:**\n\n* Staneva, J., Ricker, M., Akp\u0131nar, A., Behrens, A., Giesen, R., & von Schuckmann, K.

The damages caused by severe wave storms can be considerable not only in infrastructure and buildings but also in the natural habitat, crops and ecosystems affected by erosion and flooding aggravated by the extreme wave heights. In addition, wave storms strongly hamper the maritime activities, especially in harbours. These extreme phenomena drive complex hydrodynamic processes, whose understanding is paramount for proper infrastructure management, design and maintenance (Goda, 2010). In recent years, there have been several studies searching possible trends in wave conditions focusing on both mean and extreme values of significant wave height using a multi-source approach with model reanalysis information with high variability in the time coverage, satellite altimeter records covering the last 30 years and in situ buoy measured data since the 1980s decade but with sparse information and gaps in the time series (e.g. Dodet et al., 2020; Timmermans et al., 2020; Young & Ribal, 2019). These studies highlight a remarkable interannual, seasonal and spatial variability of wave conditions and suggest that the possible observed trends are not clearly associated with anthropogenic forcing (Hochet et al. 2021, 2023).\nFor the Mediterranean Sea an interesting publication (De Leo et al., 2024) analyses recent studies in this basin showing the variability in the different results and the difficulties to reach a consensus, especially in the mean wave conditions. The only significant conclusion is the positive trend in extreme values for the western Mediterranean Sea and in particular in the Gulf of Lion and in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\n**COPERNICUS MARINE SERVICE KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe mean 99th percentiles showed in the area present a range from 1.5-3.5 in the Gibraltar Strait and Alboran Sea with 0.25-0.55 of standard deviation (std), 2-5m in the East coast of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands with 0.2-0.4m of std, 3-4m in the Aegean Sea with 0.4-0.6m of std to 3-5m in the Gulf of Lyon with 0.3-0.5m of std. \nResults for this year show a positive anomaly in the Gibraltar Strait (+0.8m), and a negative anomaly in the Aegean Sea (-0.8m), the East Coast of the Iberian Peninsula (-0.7m) and in the Gulf of Lyon (-0.6), all of them slightly over the standard deviation in the respective areas.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00263\n\n**References:**\n\n* De Leo F, Briganti R & Besio G. 2024.

Daily regional mean values are calculated by performing the average (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. A fixed annual cycle is extracted from the original signal, using the Census-I method as described in Vantrepotte et al. (2009). The deasonalised time series is derived by subtracting the seasonal cycle from the original time series, and then fitted to a linear regression to, finally, obtain the linear trend. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton \u2013 and chlorophyll concentration , which is  a measure of  phytoplankton concentration \u2013 respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions. Chlorophyll concentration is highly seasonal in the Arctic Ocean region due to a strong dependency on light and nutrient availability, which in turn are driven by seasonal sunlight and sea-ice cover dynamics, as well as changes in mixed layer. In the past two decades, an increase in annual net primary production by Arctic Ocean phytoplankton has been observed and linked to sea-ice decline (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015); in the same line Kahru et al. (2011) have showed that chlorophyll concentration peaks are appearing increasingly earlier in the year in parts of the Arctic. It is therefore of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales in the area, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWhile the overall trend average for the 1997-2021 period in the Arctic Sea is positive (0.86 \u00b1 0.17 % per year), a continued plateau in the linear trend, initiated in 2013 is observed in the time series extension, with both the amplitude and the baseline of the cycle continuing to decrease during 2021 as reported for previous years (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). In particular, the annual average for the region in 2021 is 1.05 mg m-3 - a 30% reduction on 2020 values. There appears to be no appreciable changes in the timings or amplitude of the 2021 spring and autumn blooms. \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00188\n\n**References:**\n\n* Arrigo, K.

The response in the North Atlantic ranges from cyclical to decadal oscillations (Henson et al., 2009); it is therefore of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the North Atlantic are known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with the initiation of the spring bloom showing a nominal correlation with sea surface temperature and the NAO index (Zhai et al., 2013).\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nWhile the overall trend average for the 1997-2021 period in the North Atlantic Ocean is slightly positive (0.16 \u00b1 0.12 % per year), an underlying low frequency harmonic signal can be seen in the deseasonalised data. The annual average for the region in 2021 is 0.25 mg m-3. Though no appreciable changes in the timing of the spring and autumn blooms have been observed during 2021, a lower peak chlorophyll concentration is observed in the timeseries extension. This decrease in peak concentration with respect to the previous year is contributing to the reduction trend.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00194\n\n**References:**\n\n* Henson, S.

The character of the response in the Baltic Sea depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Kahru and Elmgren 2014) and anthropogenic climate change. Eutrophication is one of the most important issues for the Baltic Sea (HELCOM, 2018), therefore the use of long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record is crucial for detecting eutrophication. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nOn average, the trend for the Baltic Sea over the 1997-2023 period is relatively flat (0.08%). The pattern of positive and negative trends is quite similar to the previous release, indicating a general decrease in absolute values. This result aligns with the findings of Sathyendranath et al. (2018), which show an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in most of the European Seas.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00198\n\n**References:**\n\n* Brando, V.E., A.

Nevertheless, this negative trend is lower than the one estimated in the previous release (both 1997-2021 and 1997-2022). The negative trend is mainly due to the marked change on chlorophyll concentrations between 2002 and 2004. From 2004 onwards, minima and maxima are strongly variable year by year. However, on average, the minima/maxima variability can be considered quite constant with a continuous decrease of maxima from 2015 up to mid 2020 where signal seems to change again with relative high chlorophyll values in 2021, 2022 and especially in the last year (2023). The general negative trend in the Black Sea is also confirmed by the analysis of Sathyendranath et al. (2018), that reveals an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in all the European Seas, except for the Black Sea.\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00211\n\n**References:**\n\n* Basterretxea, G., Font-Mu\u00f1oz, J.

The overall negative trend in the map is in accordance with the results of Bengil and Mavruk (2018), that revealed a decreasing trend of chlorophyll during the post-eutrophication phase in the years 1997-2017.\n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00212\n\n**References:**\n\n* Basterretxea, G., Font-Mu\u00f1oz, J.

The trend detection method is based on the Census-I algorithm as described by Vantrepotte et al. (2009), where the time series is decomposed as a fixed seasonal cycle plus a linear trend component plus a residual component. The linear trend is expressed in % year -1, and its level of significance (p) calculated using a t-test. Only significant trends (p < 0.05) are included. \n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton are key actors in the carbon cycle and, as such, recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Chlorophyll concentration is the most widely used measure of the concentration of phytoplankton present in the ocean. Drivers for chlorophyll variability range from small-scale seasonal cycles to long-term climate oscillations and, most importantly, anthropogenic climate change. Due to such diverse factors, the detection of climate signals requires a long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe average global trend for the 1997-2021 period was 0.51% per year, with a maximum value of 25% per year and a minimum value of -6.1% per year. Positive trends are pronounced in the high latitudes of both northern and southern hemispheres. The significant increases in chlorophyll reported in 2016-2017 (Sathyendranath et al., 2018b) for the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at high latitudes appear to be plateauing after the 2021 extension.  The negative trends shown in equatorial waters in 2020 appear to be remain consistent in 2021.  \n\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00230\n\n**References:**\n\n* Jackson, T.

This dataset, derived from multi-sensor (SeaStar-SeaWiFS, AQUA-MODIS, NOAA20-VIIRS, NPP-VIIRS, Envisat-MERIS and Sentinel3-OLCI) Rrs spectra produced by CNR using an in-house processing chain, is obtained by means of the Mediterranean Ocean Colour regional algorithms: an updated version of the MedOC4 (Case 1 (off-shore) waters, Volpe et al., 2019, with new coefficients) and AD4 (Case 2 (coastal) waters, Berthon and Zibordi, 2004). The processing chain and the techniques used for algorithms merging are detailed in Colella et al. (2023). Monthly regional mean values are calculated by performing the average of 2D monthly mean (weighted by pixel area) over the region of interest. The deseasonalized time series is obtained by applying the X-11 seasonal adjustment methodology on the original time series as described in Colella et al. (2016), and then the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are subsequently applied to obtain the magnitude of trend.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton   and chlorophyll concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton   respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). Therefore, it is of critical importance to monitor chlorophyll concentration at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in order to be able to separate potential long-term climate signals from natural variability in the short term. In particular, phytoplankton in the Mediterranean Sea is known to respond to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nin\u0303o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Basterretxea et al. 2018, Colella et al. 2016).\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, the trend average for the 1997-2023 period is slightly negative (-0.73\u00b10.65% per year) emphasising the results obtained from previous release (1997-2022). This result is in contrast with the analysis of Sathyendranath et al. (2018) that reveals an increasing trend in chlorophyll concentration in all the European Seas. Starting from 2010-2011, except for 2018-2019, the decrease of chlorophyll concentrations is quite evident in the deseasonalized timeseries (in green), and in the maxima of the observations (grey line), starting from 2015. This attenuation of chlorophyll values of the last decade, results in an overall negative trend for the Mediterranean Sea.\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00259\n\n**References:**\n\n* Basterretxea, G., Font-Mu\u00f1oz, J.

The processing chain and the techniques used for algorithms merging are detailed in Colella et al. (2023). \nThe trend map is obtained by applying Colella et al. (2016) methodology, where the Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1975) and Sens\u2019s method (Sen, 1968) are applied on deseasonalized monthly time series, as obtained from the X-11 technique (see e. g. Pezzulli et al. 2005), to estimate, trend magnitude and its significance. The trend is expressed in % per year that represents the relative changes (i.e., percentage) corresponding to the dimensional trend [mg m-3 y-1] with respect to the reference climatology (1997-2014). Only significant trends (p < 0.05) are included.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nPhytoplankton are key actors in the carbon cycle and, as such, recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Chlorophyll concentration - as a proxy for phytoplankton - respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrients and mixing (Colella et al. 2016). The character of the response depends on the nature of the change drivers, and ranges from seasonal cycles to decadal oscillations (Basterretxea et al. 2018). The Mediterranean Sea is an oligotrophic basin, where chlorophyll concentration decreases following a specific gradient from West to East (Colella et al. 2016). The highest concentrations are observed in coastal areas and at the river mouths, where the anthropogenic pressure and nutrient loads impact on the eutrophication regimes (Colella et al. 2016). The the use of long-term time series of consistent, well-calibrated, climate-quality data record is crucial for detecting eutrophication. Furthermore, chlorophyll analysis also demands the use of robust statistical temporal decomposition techniques, in order to separate the long-term signal from the seasonal component of the time series.\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**\n\nChlorophyll trend in the Mediterranean Sea, for the period 1997-2023, generally confirm trend results of the previous release with negative values over most of the basin. In Ligurian Sea, negative trend is slightly emphasized. As for the previous release, the southern part of the western Mediterranean basin, Rhode Gyre and in the northern coast of the Aegean Sea show weak positive trend areas but they seems weaker than previous ones. On average the trend in the Mediterranean Sea is about -0.83% per year, emphasizing the mean negative trend achieved in the previous release. Contrary to what shown by Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019) in their analysis (related to 1998-2014 satellite observations), western and eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea do not show differences. In the Ligurian Sea, the trend switch to negative values, differing from the positive regime observed in the trend maps of both Colella et al. (2016) and Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019), referred, respectively, to 1998-2009 and 1998-2014 period, respectively. The waters offshore the Po River mouth show weak negative trend values, partially differing from the markable negative regime observed in the 1998-2009 period (Colella et al., 2016), and definitely moving from the positive trend observed by Salgado-Hernanz et al. (2019).\n**DOI (product):** \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00260\n\n**References:**\n\n* Basterretxea, G., Font-Mu\u00f1oz, J. S., Salgado-Hernanz, P. M., Arrieta, J., & Hern\u00e1ndez-Carrasco, I.

This circulation varies at interannual and multidecadal time scales and it is composed of an upper zonal cell (Zonal Overturning Circulation) and two main meridional cells in the western and eastern Mediterranean (Pinardi and Masetti 2000).\nThe objective is to monitor the main water mass formation events using the eddy resolving Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis (Escudier et al. 2020, 2021) and considering Pinardi et al. (2015) and Simoncelli and Pinardi (2018) as references for the methodology. The Mediterranean Sea Reanalysis can reproduce both Eastern Mediterranean Transient and Western Mediterranean Transition phenomena and catches the principal water mass formation events reported in the literature. This will permit constant monitoring of the open ocean deep convection process in the Mediterranean Sea and a better understanding of the multiple drivers of the general overturning circulation at interannual and multidecadal time scales. \nDeep and intermediate water formation events reveal themselves by a deep mixed layer depth distribution in four Mediterranean areas (Table 1 and Figure 2): Gulf of Lions, Southern Adriatic Sea Pit, Cretan Sea and Rhodes Gyre. \n\n**CMEMS KEY FINDINGS**\n\nThe Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) formation events in the Gulf of Lion appear to be larger after 1999 consistently with Schroeder et al. (2006, 2008) related to the Eastern Mediterranean Transient event. This modification of WMDW after 2005 has been called Western Mediterranean Transition. WMDW formation events are consistent with Somot et al. (2016) and the event in 2009 is also reported in Houpert et al. (2016). \nThe Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) formation in the Southern Adriatic Pit region displays a period of water mass formation between 1988 and 1993, in agreement with Pinardi et al. (2015), in 1996, 1999 and 2000 as documented by Manca et al. (2002). Weak deep water formation in winter 2006 is confirmed by observations in Vilibi\u0107 and \u0160anti\u0107 (2008). An intense deep water formation event is detected in 2012-2013 (Ga\u010di\u0107 et al., 2014). Last years are characterized by large events starting from 2017 (Mihanovic et al., 2021).\nCretan Intermediate Water formation rates present larger peaks between 1989 and 1993 with the ones in 1992 and 1993 composing the Eastern Mediterranean Transient phenomena. The Cretan Deep Water formed in 1992 and 1993 is characterized by the highest densities of the entire period in accordance with Velaoras et al. (2014).\nThe Levantine Deep Water formation rate in the Rhode Gyre region presents the largest values between 1992 and 1993 in agreement with Kontoyiannis et al. (1999). \n\n**Figure caption**\n\nWater mass formation rates [Sverdrup] computed in 4 regions: in the Gulf of Lion for the Western Mediterranean Deep Waters (WMDW); in the Southern Adriatic region for the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Waters (EMDW); in the Cretan Sea for the Cretan Intermediate Waters (CIW) and the Cretan Deep Waters (CDW); in the Rhode Gyre area for the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) and the Levantine Deep Waters (LDW).

The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS BS Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00157\n\n**References:**\n\n* Marullo, S., Santoleri, R., Ciani, D., Le Borgne, P., P\u00e9r\u00e9, S., Pinardi, N., ... & Nardone, G.

SSTfnd is defined within GHRSST as the temperature at the base of the diurnal thermocline. It is so named because it represents the foundation temperature on which the diurnal thermocline develops during the day. SSTfnd changes only gradually along with the upper layer of the ocean, and by definition it is independent of skin SST fluctuations due to wind- and radiation-dependent diurnal stratification or skin layer response. It is therefore updated at intervals of 24 hrs. SSTfnd corresponds to the temperature of the upper mixed layer which is the part of the ocean represented by the top-most layer of grid cells in most numerical ocean models. It is never observed directly by satellites, but it comes closest to being detected by infrared and microwave radiometers during the night, when the previous day's diurnal stratification can be assumed to have decayed.\n\nThe processing combines the observations of multiple polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, embedding infrared of microwave radiometers. All these sources are intercalibrated with each other before merging. A ranking procedure is used to select the best sensor observation for each grid point. An optimal interpolation is used to fill in where observations are missing.\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00321", "doi": "10.48670/mds-00321", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,global-ocean,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,near-real-time,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-temperature,sst-glo-phy-l4-nrt-010-043,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": "proprietary", "missionStartDate": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": "Level 4", "providers": [{"name": "MET Norway", "roles": ["producer"]}, {"name": "Copernicus Marine Service", "roles": ["host", "processor"], "url": "https://marine.copernicus.eu"}], "title": "ODYSSEA Global Sea Surface Temperature Gridded Level 4 Daily Multi-Sensor Observations"}, "SST_GLO_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_010": {"abstract": "For the Global Ocean- Sea Surface Temperature L3 Observations .

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS MED Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n \n[How to cite](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-or-reference-copernicus-marine-products-and-services)\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00170\n\n**References:**\n\n* Marullo, S., Santoleri, R., Ciani, D., Le Borgne, P., P\u00e9r\u00e9, S., Pinardi, N., ... & Nardone, G.

Remotely-sensed L4 SST datasets are operationally produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR-GOS). These SST products are based on the nighttime images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms, and cover the Southern European Seas. The main upstream data currently used include SLSTR-3A/3B, VIIRS-N20/NPP, Metop-B/C AVHRR and SEVIRI. The CNR-GOS processing chain includes several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at high (HR 0.0625\u00b0) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, applying statistical techniques. Since November 2024, the L4 MED UHR processing chain makes use of an improved background field as initial guess for the Optimal Interpolation of this product. The improvement is obtained in terms of the effective spatial resolution via the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN). These L4 data are also used to estimate the SST anomaly with respect to a pentad climatology.

Using linear propagation wave model, only wave observations that can be back-propagated to wave converging regions are considered. The dataset parameters includes partition significant wave height, partition peak period and partition peak or principal direction given along swell propagation path in space and time at a 3-hour timestep, from source to land. Validity flags are also included for each parameter and indicates the valid time steps along propagation (eg. no propagation for significant wave height close to the storm source or any integral parameter when reaching the land). The integral parameters at observation point are also available together with a quality flag based on the consistency between each propagated observation and the overall swell field.This product is processed by the WAVE-TAC multi-mission SAR data processing system.

The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (FDRB) describes how terrestrial surfaces reflect the sun radiation. Its potential has been demonstrated for several applications in land surface studies (see Bicheron and Leroy, 2000). The space-borne POLDER-1/ADEOS-1 instrument (November 1996 \u2013 June 1997) has provided the first opportunity to sample the BRDF of every point on Earth for viewing angles up to 60\u00b0-70\u00b0, and for the full azimuth range, at a spatial resolution of about 6km, when the atmospheric conditions are favorable (Hautecoeur et Leroy, 1998). From April to October 2003, the land surface BRDF was sampled by the POLDER-2/ADEOS-2 sensor. From March 2005, the POLDER-3 sensor onboard the PARASOL microsatellite measures the bi-driectional reflectance of the continental ecosystems. These successive observations allowed building : 1- a BRDF database from the 8 months of POLDER-1 mesurements : The POLDER-1 BRDF data base compiles 24,857 BRDFs acquired by ADEOS-1/POLDER-1 during 8 months, from November, 1996 to June, 1997, on a maximum number of sites describing the natural variability of continental ecosystems, at several seasons whenever possible. The POLDER-1 bidirectional reflectances have been corrected from atmospheric effects using the advanced Level 2 algorithms developed for the processing line of the ADEOS-2/POLDER-2 data. The BRDF database has been implemented on the basis of the 22 vegetation classes of the GLC2000. 2- a BRDF database from the 7 months of POLDER-2 measurements : The POLDER-2 BRDF data base compiles 24,090 BRDFs acquired by ADEOS-2/POLDER-2 from April ro October 2003, on a maximum number of sites describing the natural variability of continental ecosystems, at several seasons whenever possible. The POLDER-2 bidirectional reflectances have been corrected from atmospheric effects using the advanced Level 2 algorithms described on the CNES scientific Web site.

Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available.

Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but was relicensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) in March, 2023. \n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org) provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`) corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\n\n## Accessing the data\n\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n* [Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY SA 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by-sa#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 179MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40]              |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-SA-40]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax` for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations in the above table include all three variables.\n\n[^2]: The institution which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org) provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`) corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\n\n## Accessing the data\n\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data license:\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\n* [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\n\nEach modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection) to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing, Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project) for citations and additional information about each license.\n\n## Data format & contents\n\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude). The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\n\nHistorical data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily, excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100, depending on data availability in the source GCM.\n\nThe spatial domain covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the \u201clon\u201d coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201clat\u201d coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each 0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\n\n## Available institutions, models, and scenarios by license collection\n\n| Modeling institution |   Source model    |           Available experiments            |   License collection   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| CAS                  | FGOALS-g3 [^1]    | SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5           | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM4-8         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| INM                  | INM-CM5-0         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | Public domain datasets |\n| BCC                  | BCC-CSM2-MR       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-CM2-SR5      | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CMCC                 | CMCC-ESM2         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO-ARCCSS         | ACCESS-CM2        | SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| CSIRO                | ACCESS-ESM1-5     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC-ES2L        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MIROC                | MIROC6            | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | HadGEM3-GC31-LL   | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| MOHC                 | UKESM1-0-LL       | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M                | MPI-ESM1-2-LR     | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| MPI-M/DKRZ [^2]      | MPI-ESM1-2-HR     | SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-LM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NCC                  | NorESM2-MM        | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-CM4          | SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5                      | CC-BY-40               |\n| NOAA-GFDL            | GFDL-ESM4         | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| NUIST                | NESM3             | SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5           | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3         | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-AerChem | ssp370                                     | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-CC      | ssp245 and ssp585                          | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg     | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| EC-Earth-Consortium  | EC-Earth3-Veg-LR  | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 | CC-BY-40               |\n| CCCma                | CanESM5           | ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, ssp5-8.5     | CC-BY-40[^3]           |\n\n*Notes:*\n\n[^1]: At the time of running, no ssp1-2.6 precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax` for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations in the above table include all three variables.\n\n[^2]: The institution which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP` scenarios.\n\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but was relicensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) in March, 2023. \n\n## Project methods\n\nThis project makes use of statistical bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year to a reference dataset (ERA5).\n\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\n\nTogether, these methods provide a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\n\nFor further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts research (GDPCIR): preserving extremes for modeling future climate impacts](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1513/) (EGUsphere, 2022 [preprint]).\n\n\n## Citing, licensing, and using data produced by this project\n\nProjects making use of the data produced as part of the Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (CIL GDPCIR) project are requested to cite both this project and the source datasets from which these results are derived. Additionally, the use of data derived from some GCMs *requires* citations, and some modeling centers impose licensing restrictions & requirements on derived works.

CONUS404, so named because it covers the CONterminous United States for over 40 years at 4 km resolution, was produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations run by NCAR as part of a collaboration with the USGS Water Mission Area. The CONUS404 includes 42 years of data (water years 1980-2021) and the spatial domain extends beyond the CONUS into Canada and Mexico, thereby capturing transboundary river basins and covering all contributing areas for CONUS surface waters.\n\nThe CONUS404 dataset, produced using WRF version 3.9.1.1, is the successor to the CONUS1 dataset in [ds612.0](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds612.0/) (Liu, et al., 2017) with improved representation of weather and climate conditions in the central United States due to the addition of a shallow groundwater module and several other improvements in the NOAH-Multiparameterization land surface model.

At the coastline, the model is forced by extreme water levels containing surge and tide from GTSMip6. The water level at the coastline is extended landwards to all areas that are hydrodynamically connected to the coast following a \u2018bathtub\u2019 like approach and calculates the flood depth as the difference between the water level and the topography. Unlike a simple 'bathtub' model, this model attenuates the water level over land with a maximum attenuation factor of 0.5\u2009m\u2009km-1. The attenuation factor simulates the dampening of the flood levels due to the roughness over land.\n\nIn its current version, the model does not account for varying roughness over land and permanent water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and it does not account for the compound effects of waves, rainfall, and river discharge on coastal flooding. It also does not include the mitigating effect of coastal flood protection.

The horizontal axis shows *forecast times* in 3-hour intervals out from the reference time. A black square over a particular forecast time, or step, indicates that a forecast is made for that forecast time, for that particular `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time` combination.\n\n* **stream** is the forecasting system that produced the data. The values are available in the `ecmwf:stream` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `enfo`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), atmospheric fields\n  * `mmsf`: [multi-model seasonal forecasts](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast) fields from the ECMWF model only.\n  * `oper`: [high-resolution forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast), atmospheric fields \n  * `scda`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, atmospheric fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\")\n  * `scwv`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, ocean wave fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\") and\n  * `waef`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), ocean wave fields,\n  * `wave`: wave model\n* **type** is the forecast type.

The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:type`: The forecast type (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:step`: The offset from the reference datetime, expressed as `<value><unit>`, for example `\"3h\"` means \"3 hours from the reference datetime\". \n* `ecmwf:reference_datetime`: The datetime when the model was run. This indicates when the forecast *was made*, rather than when it's valid for.\n* `ecmwf:forecast_datetime`: The datetime for which the forecast is valid. This is also set as the item's `datetime`.\n\nSee the example notebook for more on how to use the STAC metadata to query for particular data.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe products listed and described on this page are available to the public and their use is governed by the [Creative Commons CC-4.0-BY license and the ECMWF Terms of Use](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/).

ERA5 is produced by the\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a\nglobally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This\nprinciple, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical\nweather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a\nprevious forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal\nway to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called\nanalysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works\nin the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a\ndataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint\nof issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and\nwhen going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions\nof the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis\nproduct.\n\nThis dataset was converted to Zarr by [Planet OS](https://planetos.com/).\nSee [their documentation](https://github.com/planet-os/notebooks/blob/master/aws/era5-pds.md)\nfor more.\n\n## STAC Metadata\n\nTwo types of data variables are provided: \"forecast\" (`fc`) and \"analysis\" (`an`).\n\n* An **analysis**, of the atmospheric conditions, is a blend of observations\n  with a previous forecast.

The operational GOES-R Satellites, GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18, capture 16-band imagery from geostationary orbits over the Western Hemisphere via the Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) radiometer. The ABI captures 2 visible, 4 near-infrared, and 10 infrared channels at resolutions between 0.5km and 2km.\n\n### Geographic coverage\n\nThe ABI captures three levels of coverage, each at a different temporal cadence depending on the modes described below. The geographic coverage for each image is described by the `goes:image-type` STAC Item property.\n\n- _FULL DISK_: a circular image depicting nearly full coverage of the Western Hemisphere.\n- _CONUS_: a 3,000 (lat) by 5,000 (lon) km rectangular image depicting the Continental U.S. (GOES-16) or the Pacific Ocean including Hawaii (GOES-17).\n- _MESOSCALE_: a 1,000 by 1,000 km rectangular image. GOES-16 and 17 both alternate between two different mesoscale geographic regions.\n\n### Modes\n\nThere are three standard scanning modes for the ABI instrument: Mode 3, Mode 4, and Mode 6.\n\n- Mode _3_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, three observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and thirty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every fifteen minutes.\n- Mode _4_ consists of the observation of the full disk scene every five minutes.\n- Mode _6_ consists of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, two observations of the continental United States (CONUS), and twenty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale views every ten minutes.\n\nThe mode that each image was captured with is described by the `goes:mode` STAC Item property.\n\nSee this [ABI Scan Mode Demonstration](https://youtu.be/_c5H6R-M0s8) video for an idea of how the ABI scans multiple geographic regions over time.\n\n### Cloud and Moisture Imagery\n\nThe Cloud and Moisture Imagery product contains one or more images with pixel values identifying \"brightness values\" that are scaled to support visual analysis.  Cloud and Moisture Imagery product (CMIP) files are generated for each of the sixteen ABI reflective and emissive bands. In addition, there is a multi-band product file that includes the imagery at all bands (MCMIP).\n\nThe Planetary Computer STAC Collection `goes-cmi` captures both the CMIP and MCMIP product files into individual STAC Items for each observation from a GOES-R satellite. It contains the original CMIP and MCMIP NetCDF files, as well as cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) exports of the data from each MCMIP band (2km); the full-resolution CMIP band for bands 1, 2, 3, and 5; and a Web Mercator COG of bands 1, 2 and 3, which are useful for rendering.\n\nThis product is not in a standard coordinate reference system (CRS), which can cause issues with some tooling that does not handle non-standard large geographic regions.\n\n### For more information\n- [Beginner\u2019s Guide to GOES-R Series Data](https://www.goes-r.gov/downloads/resources/documents/Beginners_Guide_to_GOES-R_Series_Data.pdf)\n- [GOES-R Series Product Definition and Users\u2019 Guide: Volume 5 (Level 2A+ Products)](https://www.goes-r.gov/products/docs/PUG-L2+-vol5.pdf) ([Spanish verison](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/raw/main/GOES/QuickGuides/Spanish/Guia%20introductoria%20para%20datos%20de%20la%20serie%20GOES-R%20V1.1%20FINAL2%20-%20Copy.pdf))\n\n", "instrument": "ABI", "keywords": "abi,cloud,goes,goes-16,goes-17,goes-18,goes-cmi,moisture,nasa,noaa,satellite", "license": "proprietary", "missionStartDate": "2017-02-28T00:16:52Z", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": "GOES-16,GOES-17,GOES-18", "processingLevel": null, "title": "GOES-R Cloud & Moisture Imagery"}, "goes-glm": {"abstract": "The [Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)](https://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/glm.html) is a single-channel, near-infrared optical transient detector that can detect the momentary changes in an optical scene, indicating the presence of lightning.

This dataset complements our other releases.\n\nFor more information, see the [GlobalMLBuildingFootprints](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints/) repository on GitHub.\n\n## Building footprint creation\n\nThe building extraction is done in two stages:\n\n1. Semantic Segmentation \u2013 Recognizing building pixels on an aerial image using deep neural networks (DNNs)\n2. Polygonization \u2013 Converting building pixel detections into polygons\n\n**Stage 1: Semantic Segmentation**\n\n![Semantic segmentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints/main/images/segmentation.jpg)\n\n**Stage 2: Polygonization**\n\n![Polygonization](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints/raw/main/images/polygonization.jpg)\n\n## Data assets\n\nThe building footprints are provided as a set of [geoparquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet) datasets in [Delta][delta] table format.\nThe data are partitioned by\n\n1.

We recommend using data with a processing date\nof 2023-04-25 or newer. This processing date is part of the URL for each parquet file and is captured in the STAC metadata\nfor each item (see below).\n\n## Delta Format\n\nThe collection-level asset under the `delta` key gives you the fsspec-style URL\nto the Delta table. This can be used to efficiently query for matching partitions\nby `Region` and `quadkey`. See the notebook for an example using Python.\n\n## STAC metadata\n\nThis STAC collection has one STAC item per region. The `msbuildings:region`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific region, and the `msbuildings:quadkey`\nproperty can be used to filter items to a specific quadkey (though you can also search\nby the `geometry`).\n\nNote that older STAC items are not spatially partitioned.

The Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products in this Collection consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. The ellipsoid projection of the GRD products is corrected using the terrain height specified in the product general annotation. The terrain height used varies in azimuth but is constant in range (but can be different for each IW/EW sub-swath).\n\nGround range coordinates are the slant range coordinates projected onto the ellipsoid of the Earth. Pixel values represent detected amplitude. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has approximately square resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at a cost of reduced spatial resolution.\n\nFor the IW and EW GRD products, multi-looking is performed on each burst individually. All bursts in all sub-swaths are then seamlessly merged to form a single, contiguous, ground range, detected image per polarization.\n\nFor more information see the [ESA documentation](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/product-types-processing-levels/level-1)\n\n### Terrain Correction\n\nUsers might want to geometrically or radiometrically terrain correct the Sentinel-1 GRD data from this collection.

The Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) data in this collection is a radiometrically terrain corrected product derived from the [Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-1-grd) products produced by the European Space Agency. The RTC processing is performed by [Catalyst](https://catalyst.earth/).\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction accounts for terrain variations that affect both the position of a given point on the Earth's surface and the brightness of the radar return, as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover-induced backscatter differences. Additionally, comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning.\n\nA Planetary Computer account is required to retrieve SAS tokens to read the RTC data. See the [documentation](http://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/#when-an-account-is-needed) for more information.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe Sentinel-1 GRD product is converted to calibrated intensity using the conversion algorithm described in the ESA technical note ESA-EOPG-CSCOP-TN-0002, [Radiometric Calibration of S-1 Level-1 Products Generated by the S-1 IPF](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/S1-Radiometric-Calibration-V1.0.pdf). The flat earth calibration values for gamma correction (i.e. perpendicular to the radar line of sight) are extracted from the GRD metadata. The calibration coefficients are applied as a two-dimensional correction in range (by sample number) and azimuth (by time). All available polarizations are calibrated and written as separate layers of a single file. The calibrated SAR output is reprojected to nominal map orientation with north at the top and west to the left.\n\nThe data is then radiometrically terrain corrected using PlanetDEM as the elevation source. The correction algorithm is nominally based upon D. Small, [\u201cFlattening Gamma: Radiometric Terrain Correction for SAR Imagery\u201d](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/sentinel-1/2011_Flattening_Gamma.pdf), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol 49, No 8., August 2011, pp 3081-3093. For each image scan line, the digital elevation model is interpolated to determine the elevation corresponding to the position associated with the known near slant range distance and arc length for each input pixel. The elevations at the four corners of each pixel are estimated using bilinear resampling. The four elevations are divided into two triangular facets and reprojected onto the plane perpendicular to the radar line of sight to provide an estimate of the area illuminated by the radar for each earth flattened pixel. The uncalibrated sum at each earth flattened pixel is normalized by dividing by the flat earth surface area. The adjustment for gamma intensity is given by dividing the normalized result by the cosine of the incident angle. Pixels which are not illuminated by the radar due to the viewing geometry are flagged as shadow.\n\nCalibrated data is then orthorectified to the appropriate UTM projection. The orthorectified output maintains the original sample sizes (in range and azimuth) and was not shifted to any specific grid.\n\nRTC data is processed only for the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which is the main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements.\n", "instrument": null, "keywords": "c-band,copernicus,esa,rtc,sar,sentinel,sentinel-1,sentinel-1-rtc,sentinel-1a,sentinel-1b", "license": "CC-BY-4.0", "missionStartDate": "2014-10-10T00:28:21Z", "platform": "Sentinel-1", "platformSerialIdentifier": "SENTINEL-1A,SENTINEL-1B", "processingLevel": null, "title": "Sentinel 1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC)"}, "sentinel-2-l2a": {"abstract": "The [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) program provides global imagery in thirteen spectral bands at 10m-60m resolution and a revisit time of approximately five days.

The CDL is a crop-specific land cover classification product of more than 100 crop categories grown in the United States. CDLs are derived using a supervised land cover classification of satellite imagery. The supervised classification relies on first manually identifying pixels within certain images, often called training sites, which represent the same crop or land cover type. Using these training sites, a spectral signature is developed for each crop type that is then used by the analysis software to identify all other pixels in the satellite image representing the same crop. Using this method, a new CDL is compiled annually and released to the public a few months after the end of the growing season.\n\nThis collection includes Cropland, Confidence, Cultivated, and Frequency products.\n\n- Cropland: Crop-specific land cover data created annually.

the ARCTIC_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHYS_002_001_a physical forecast. It is run daily to provide 10 days of forecast of 3D biogeochemical variables ocean. The coupling is done by the FABM framework.\n\nCoupling to a biological ocean model provides a description of the evolution of basic biogeochemical variables. The output consists of daily mean fields interpolated onto a standard grid and 40 fixed levels in NetCDF4 CF format. Variables include 3D fields of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, silicate), phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, oxygen, chlorophyll, primary productivity, carbon cycle variables (pH, dissolved inorganic carbon and surface partial CO2 pressure in seawater, carbon export) and light attenuation coefficient. Surface Chlorophyll-a from satellite ocean colour is assimilated every week and projected downwards using the Uitz et al. (2006) method. A new 10-day forecast is produced daily using the previous day's forecast and the most up-to-date prognostic forcing fields.\nOutput products have 6.25 km resolution at the North Pole (equivalent to 1/8 deg) on a stereographic projection.

system - TOPAZ4b -  is nearly identical to the real-time forecast system run at MET Norway. It uses a recent version of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) developed at University of Miami (Bleck 2002). HYCOM is coupled to a sea ice model; ice thermodynamics are described in Drange and Simonsen (1996) and the elastic-viscous-plastic rheology in Hunke and Dukowicz (1997). The model's native grid covers the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans,  has fairly homogeneous horizontal spacing (between 11 and 16 km). 50 hybrid layers are used in the vertical (z-isopycnal), more than the TOPAZ4 system (28 layers). TOPAZ4b uses the Deterministic version of the Ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF; Sakov and Oke 2008) to assimilate remotely sensed as well as temperature and salinity profiles. The output is interpolated onto standard grids and depths. Daily values are provided at all depths. Data assimilation, including the 100-member ensemble production, is performed weekly.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00007", "instrument": null, "keywords": "arctic-ocean,coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:arctic-multiyear-phy-002-003:cmems-mod-arc-phy-my-topaz4-p1m-202012,in-situ-ts-profiles,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,ocean-barotropic-streamfunction,ocean-mixed-layer-thickness,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-floor-depth-below-sea-level,sea-ice-area-fraction,sea-ice-concentration-and/or-thickness,sea-ice-thickness,sea-ice-x-velocity,sea-ice-y-velocity,sea-level,sea-surface-elevation,sea-water-potential-temperature,sea-water-potential-temperature-at-sea-floor,sea-water-salinity,sst,surface-snow-thickness,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting,x-sea-water-velocity,y-sea-water-velocity", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2021-12-31", "missionStartDate": "1991-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Arctic Ocean Physics Reanalysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_002_003:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_topaz4_P1Y_202211": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_002_003:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_topaz4_P1Y_202211", "instrument": null, "keywords": "arctic-ocean,coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:arctic-multiyear-phy-002-003:cmems-mod-arc-phy-my-topaz4-p1y-202211,in-situ-ts-profiles,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,ocean-barotropic-streamfunction,ocean-mixed-layer-thickness,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-floor-depth-below-sea-level,sea-ice-area-fraction,sea-ice-concentration-and/or-thickness,sea-ice-thickness,sea-ice-x-velocity,sea-ice-y-velocity,sea-level,sea-surface-elevation,sea-water-potential-temperature,sea-water-potential-temperature-at-sea-floor,sea-water-salinity,sst,surface-snow-thickness,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting,x-sea-water-velocity,y-sea-water-velocity", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2021-12-31", "missionStartDate": "1991-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Arctic Ocean Physics Reanalysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ICE_002_016:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_nextsim_P1D-m_202411": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ICE_002_016:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_nextsim_P1D-m_202411", "instrument": null, "keywords": "eo:mo:dat:arctic-multiyear-phy-ice-002-016:cmems-mod-arc-phy-my-nextsim-p1d-m-202411", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": null}, "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ICE_002_016:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_nextsim_P1M-m_202411": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ICE_002_016:cmems_mod_arc_phy_my_nextsim_P1M-m_202411", "instrument": null, "keywords": "eo:mo:dat:arctic-multiyear-phy-ice-002-016:cmems-mod-arc-phy-my-nextsim-p1m-m-202411", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": null, "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": null}, "EO:MO:DAT:BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_003_007:cmems_mod_bal_bgc-pp_anfc_7-10days_P1D-i_202411": {"abstract": "'''Short description:'''\n\nThis Baltic Sea biogeochemical model product provides forecasts for the biogeochemical conditions in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic forecast is updated daily providing a new six days forecast. Three different datasets are provided. One with daily means and one with monthly means values for these parameters: nitrate, phosphate, chl-a, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, ph, phytoplankton, zooplankton, silicate,  dissolved inorganic carbon, and partial pressure of co2 at the surface. Instantaenous values for the Secchi Depth and light attenuation valid for noon (12Z) are included in the daily mean files/dataset. Additionally a third dataset with daily accumulated values of the netto primary production is available.  The product is produced by the biogeochemical model ERGOM (Neumann, 2000) one way coupled to a Baltic Sea set up of  the NEMO ocean model, which provides the CMEMS Baltic physical ocean forecast product (BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_003_006). This biogeochemical product is provided at the models native grid with a resolution of 1 nautical mile in the horizontal, and up to 56 vertical depth levels. The product covers the Baltic Sea including the transition area towards the North Sea (i.e. the Danish Belts, the Kattegat and Skagerrak).\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''

physical model product provides forecasts for the physical conditions in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic forecast is updated twice daily providing a new six days forecast. Several datasets are provided: One with hourly instantaneous values, one with daily mean values and one with monthly mean values, all containing these parameters: sea level variations, ice concentration and thickness at the surface, and temperature, salinity and horizontal and vertical velocities for the 3D field. Additionally a dataset with 15 minutes (instantaneous) surface values are provided for the sea level variation and the surface horizontal currents. The product is produced by a Baltic Sea set up of the NEMOv4.0 ocean model. This product is provided at the models native grid with a resolution of 1 nautical mile in the horizontal, and up to 56 vertical depth levels. The area covers the Baltic Sea including the transition area towards the North Sea (i.e. the Danish Belts, the Kattegat and Skagerrak). The ocean model is forced with Stokes drift data from the Baltic Wave forecast product (BALTICSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_003_010). Satellite SST, ice concentrations and in-situ T and S profiles are assimilated into the model's analysis field. \n\n'''DOI (product) :'''  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00010", "instrument": null,

\n\nBLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_007_010 is the nominal product of the Black Sea Biogeochemistry NRT system and is generated by the NEMO 4.0-BAMHBI modelling system. Biogeochemical Model for Hypoxic and Benthic Influenced areas (BAMHBI) is an innovative biogeochemical model with a 28-variable pelagic component (including the carbonate system) and a 6-variable benthic component ; it explicitely represents processes in the anoxic layer.\nThe product provides analysis and forecast for 3D concentration of chlorophyll, nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton carbon biomass, net primary production, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and for 2D fields of bottom oxygen concentration (for the North-Western shelf), surface partial pressure of CO2 and surface flux of CO2. These variables are computed on a grid with ~3km x 59-levels resolution, and are provided as daily and monthly means.\n\n'''Product Citation:''' \n\nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing

BLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_007_001 is produced with a hydrodynamic model implemented over the whole Black Sea basin, including the Bosporus Strait and a portion of the Marmara Sea for the optimal interface with the Mediterranean Sea through lateral open boundary conditions. The model horizontal grid resolution is 1/40\u00b0 in zonal and 1/40\u00b0 in meridional direction (ca. 121 km) and has 121 unevenly spaced vertical levels. The product provides analysis and forecast for 3D potential temperature, salinity, horizontal and vertical currents. Together with the 2D variables sea surface height, bottom potential temperature and mixed layer thickness.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.

analysis and forecasts for the Black Sea are produced with the third generation spectral wave model WAM Cycle 6. The hindcast and ten days forecast are produced twice a day on the HPC at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. The shallow water Black Sea version is implemented on a spherical grid with a spatial resolution of about 2.5 km (1/40\u00b0 x 1/40\u00b0) with 24 directional and 30 frequency bins. The number of active wave model grid points is 74518. The model takes into account depth refraction, wave breaking, and assimilation of satellite wave and wind data. The system provides a hindcast and ten days forecast with one-hourly output twice a day. The atmospheric forcing is taken from ECMWF analyses and forecast data. Additionally, WAM is forced by surface currents and sea surface height from BLKSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_007_001. Monthly statistics are provided operationally on the Product Quality Dashboard following the CMEMS metrics definitions.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing

BLKSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_007_004 product provides monthly and daily ocean fields for the Black Sea basin starting from 01/01/1993. The hydrodynamical core is based on NEMO general circulation ocean model, implemented in the BS domain with horizontal resolution of 1/27\u00b0 x 1/36\u00b0 and 31 vertical levels. NEMO is forced by atmospheric surface fluxes computed by bulk formulation using ECMWF ERA5 atmospheric fields at the resolution of 0.25\u00b0 in space and 1-h in time. The current version has closed boundary at the Bosporus Strait. The model is online coupled to OceanVar assimilation scheme to assimilate sea level anomaly along-track observations from CMEMS and available in situ vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from both SeaDataNet and CMEMS datasets. \n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.

the Black Sea is produced with the third generation spectral wave model WAM Cycle 6. The reanalysis is produced on the HPC at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. The shallow water Black Sea version is implemented on a spherical grid with a spatial resolution of about 2.5 km (1/40\u00b0 x 1/40\u00b0) with 24 directional and 30 frequency bins. The number of active wave model grid points is 74,518. The model takes into account wave breaking and assimilation of Jason satellite wave and wind data. The system provides one-hourly output and the atmospheric forcing is taken from ECMWF ERA5 data.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.

operational global ocean analysis and forecast system of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France with a resolution of 1/12 degree is providing daily analyses and 10 days forecasts for the global ocean sea surface waves. This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves.\n \nThe global wave system of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project \u00ab my wave \u00bb (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10\u00b0. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in primary and secondary swells.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00017", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:global-analysisforecast-wav-001-027:cmems-mod-glo-wav-anfc-0.083deg-pt3h-i-202411,forecast,global-ocean,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,near-real-time,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-floor-depth-below-geoid,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wave-from-direction-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-maximum-height,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-inverse-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-second-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-period-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-x-velocity,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-y-velocity,sea-surface-wind-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wind-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-wind-wave-significant-height,significant-wave-height-(swh),weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2021-11-30", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Global Ocean Waves Analysis and Forecast"}, "EO:MO:DAT:GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029:cmems_mod_glo_bgc_my_0.25deg_P1D-m_202406": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029:cmems_mod_glo_bgc_my_0.25deg_P1D-m_202406", "instrument": null, "keywords": "/cross-discipline/rate-measurements,atlantic-ocean,brest,coastal-marine-environment,data,drivers-and-tipping-points,eo:mo:dat:global-multiyear-bgc-001-029:cmems-mod-glo-bgc-my-0.25deg-p1d-m-202406,global-ocean,invariant,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,modelling-data,multi-year,none,north-mid-atlantic-ridge,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting,wp5-assessing-state", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2022-12-31", "missionStartDate": "2023-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Hindcast"}, "EO:MO:DAT:GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029:cmems_mod_glo_bgc_my_0.25deg_P1M-m_202406": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029:cmems_mod_glo_bgc_my_0.25deg_P1M-m_202406", "instrument": null, "keywords": "/cross-discipline/rate-measurements,atlantic-ocean,brest,coastal-marine-environment,data,drivers-and-tipping-points,eo:mo:dat:global-multiyear-bgc-001-029:cmems-mod-glo-bgc-my-0.25deg-p1m-m-202406,global-ocean,invariant,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,modelling-data,multi-year,none,north-mid-atlantic-ridge,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting,wp5-assessing-state", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2022-12-31", "missionStartDate": "2023-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Hindcast"}, "EO:MO:DAT:GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029:cmems_mod_glo_bgc_myint_0.25deg_P1D-m_202406": {"abstract": "'''Short description'''\n\nThe biogeochemical hindcast for global ocean is produced at Mercator-Ocean (Toulouse.

find here the CMEMS Global Ocean Ensemble Reanalysis product at \u00bc degree resolution : monthly means of Temperature, Salinity, Currents and Ice variables for 75 vertical levels, starting from 1993 onward.\n \nGlobal ocean reanalyses are homogeneous 3D gridded descriptions of the physical state of the ocean covering several decades, produced with a numerical ocean model constrained with data assimilation of satellite and in situ observations. These reanalyses are built to be as close as possible to the observations (i.e. realistic) and in agreement with the model physics The multi-model ensemble approach allows uncertainties or error bars in the ocean state to be estimated.\n\nThe ensemble mean may even provide for certain regions and/or periods a more reliable estimate than any individual reanalysis product.\n\nThe four reanalyses, used to create the ensemble, covering \u201caltimetric era\u201d period (starting from 1st of January 1993) during which altimeter altimetry data observations are available:\n * GLORYS2V4 from Mercator Ocean (Fr);\n * ORAS5 from ECMWF;\n * GloSea5 from Met Office (UK);\n * and C-GLORSv7 from CMCC (It);\n \nThese four products provided four different time series of global ocean simulations 3D monthly estimates.

This product also bears the name of WAVERYS within the GLO-HR MFC. for correspondence to other global multi-year products like GLORYS. BIORYS. etc. The core of WAVERYS is based on the MFWAM model. a third generation wave model that calculates the wave spectrum. i.e. the distribution of sea state energy in frequency and direction on a 1/5\u00b0 irregular grid. Average wave quantities derived from this wave spectrum. such as the SWH (significant wave height) or the average wave period. are delivered on a regular 1/5\u00b0 grid with a 3h time step. The wave spectrum is discretized into 30 frequencies obtained from a geometric sequence of first member 0.035 Hz and a reason 7.5. WAVERYS takes into account oceanic currents from the GLORYS12 physical ocean reanalysis and assimilates significant wave height observed from historical altimetry missions and directional wave spectra from Sentinel 1 SAR from 2017 onwards.   \n\n'''DOI (product):'''\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00022", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:global-multiyear-wav-001-032:cmems-mod-glo-wav-myint-0.2deg-pt3h-i-202311,global-ocean,invariant,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-floor-depth-below-geoid,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wave-from-direction-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-inverse-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-second-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-period-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-x-velocity,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-y-velocity,sea-surface-wind-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wind-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-wind-wave-significant-height,significant-wave-height-(swh),weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2023-04-30", "missionStartDate": "1993-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Global Ocean Waves Reanalysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:IBI_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_005_004:cmems_mod_ibi_bgc-optics_anfc_0.027deg_P1D-m_202411": {"abstract": "'''Short description:'''\nThe IBI-MFC provides a high-resolution biogeochemical analysis and forecast product covering the European waters, and more specifically the Iberia\u2013Biscay\u2013Ireland (IBI) area.

description:'''\nThe IBI-MFC provides a high-resolution wave analysis and forecast product (run twice a day by Nologin with the support of CESGA in terms of supercomputing resources), covering the European waters, and more specifically the Iberia\u2013Biscay\u2013Ireland (IBI) area. The last 2 years before now (historic best estimates), as well as hourly instantaneous forecasts with a horizon of up to 10 days (updated on a daily basis) are available on the catalogue.\nThe IBI wave model system is based on the MFWAM model and runs on a grid of 5 km of horizontal resolution forced with the ECMWF hourly wind data. The system assimilates significant wave height (SWH) altimeter data and CFOSAT wave spectral data (supplied by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France), and it is forced by currents provided by the IBI ocean circulation system. \nThe product offers hourly instantaneous fields of different wave parameters, including Wave Height, Period and Direction for total spectrum; fields of Wind Wave (or wind sea), Primary Swell Wave and Secondary Swell for partitioned wave spectra; and the highest wave variables, such as maximum crest height and maximum crest-to-trough height. Additionally, the IBI wave system is set up to provide internally some key parameters adequate to be used as forcing in the IBI NEMO ocean model forecast run.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer

description:'''\nThe IBI-MFC provides a biogeochemical reanalysis product for the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland (IBI) area starting in 01/01/1993 and being regularly updated on a yearly basis. The model system is run by Mercator-Ocean, being the product post-processed to the user\u2019s format by Nologin with the support of CESGA in terms of supercomputing resources.\nTo this aim, an application of the biogeochemical model PISCES is run simultaneously with the ocean physical IBI reanalysis, generating both products at the same 1/12\u00b0 horizontal resolution. The PISCES model is able to simulate the first levels of the marine food web, from nutrients up to mesozooplankton and it has 24 state variables.\nThe product provides daily, monthly and yearly averages of the main biogeochemical variables:  chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, iron, ammonium, net primary production, euphotic zone depth, phytoplankton carbon, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon and surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Additionally, climatological parameters (monthly mean and standard deviation) of these variables for the period 1993-2016 are delivered.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ

The model system is run by Nologin with the support of CESGA in terms of supercomputing resources. \nThe Multi-Year model configuration is based on the MFWAM model developed by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MF), covering the same region as the IBI-MFC Near Real Time (NRT) analysis and forecasting product, but with an enhanced horizontal resolution (1/36\u00ba instead of 1/20\u00ba). The system assimilates significant wave height (SWH) altimeter data and wave spectral data (Envisat and CFOSAT), supplied by MF. Both, the MY and the NRT products, are fed by ECMWF hourly winds. Specifically, the MY system is forced by the ERA5 reanalysis wind data. As boundary conditions, the NRT system uses the 2D wave spectra from the Copernicus Marine GLOBAL forecast system, whereas the MY system is nested to the GLOBAL reanalysis.\nThe product offers hourly instantaneous fields of different wave parameters, including Wave Height, Period and Direction for total spectrum; fields of Wind Wave (or wind sea), Primary Swell Wave and Secondary Swell for partitioned wave spectra; and the highest wave variables, such as maximum crest height and maximum crest-to-trough height. Additionally, climatological parameters of significant wave height (VHM0) and zero -crossing wave period (VTM02) are delivered for the time interval 1993-2016.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.[http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169]\n\n'''DOI (Product)''': \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00030", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,e1t,e2t,eo:mo:dat:ibi-multiyear-wav-005-006:cmems-mod-ibi-wav-my-0.027deg-climatology-p1m-m-202311,iberian-biscay-irish-seas,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-binary-mask,sea-floor-depth-below-geoid,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wave-from-direction-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-maximum-crest-height,sea-surface-wave-maximum-height,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-inverse-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-second-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-period-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-x-velocity,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-y-velocity,sea-surface-wind-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wind-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-wind-wave-significant-height,significant-wave-height-(swh),weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2022-12-30", "missionStartDate": "1993-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Atlantic -Iberian Biscay Irish- Ocean Wave Reanalysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:IBI_MULTIYEAR_WAV_005_006:cmems_mod_ibi_wav_my_0.027deg_PT1H-i_202411": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:IBI_MULTIYEAR_WAV_005_006:cmems_mod_ibi_wav_my_0.027deg_PT1H-i_202411", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,e1t,e2t,eo:mo:dat:ibi-multiyear-wav-005-006:cmems-mod-ibi-wav-my-0.027deg-pt1h-i-202411,iberian-biscay-irish-seas,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,multi-year,numerical-model,oceanographic-geographical-features,sea-binary-mask,sea-floor-depth-below-geoid,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wave-from-direction-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-maximum-crest-height,sea-surface-wave-maximum-height,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-inverse-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-second-frequency-moment,sea-surface-wave-period-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum,sea-surface-wave-significant-height,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-x-velocity,sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-y-velocity,sea-surface-wind-wave-from-direction,sea-surface-wind-wave-mean-period,sea-surface-wind-wave-significant-height,significant-wave-height-(swh),weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": "2022-12-30", "missionStartDate": "1993-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Atlantic -Iberian Biscay Irish- Ocean Wave Reanalysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:INSITU_BAL_PHYBGCWAV_DISCRETE_MYNRT_013_032:cmems_obs-ins_bal_phybgcwav_mynrt_na_irr_202311": {"abstract": "'''Short description:'''\nBaltic Sea  -

Description'''\nThe biogeochemical analysis and forecasts for the Mediterranean Sea at 1/24\u00b0 of horizontal resolution (ca. 4 km) are produced by means of the MedBFM4 model system. MedBFM4, which is run by OGS (IT), consists of the coupling of the multi-stream atmosphere radiative model OASIM, the multi-stream in-water radiative and tracer transport model OGSTM_BIOPTIMOD v4.3, and the biogeochemical flux model BFM v5. Additionally, MedBFM4 features the 3D variational data assimilation scheme 3DVAR-BIO v3.3 with the assimilation of surface chlorophyll (CMEMS-OCTAC NRT product) and of vertical profiles of chlorophyll, nitrate and oxygen (BGC-Argo floats provided by CORIOLIS DAC).\nThe biogeochemical MedBFM system, which is forced by the NEMO-OceanVar model (MEDSEA_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_006_013 product run by CMCC), produces one day of hindcast and ten days of forecast (every day) and seven days of analysis (weekly on Tuesday).\n\nSalon, S., Cossarini, G., Bolzon, G., Feudale, L., Lazzari, P., Teruzzi, A., Solidoro, C., Crise, A., 2019.

Description'''\nThe physical component of the Mediterranean Forecasting System (Med-Physics) is a coupled hydrodynamic-wave model implemented over the whole Mediterranean Basin including tides. The model horizontal grid resolution is 1/24\u02da (ca. 4 km) and has 141 unevenly spaced vertical levels.\nThe hydrodynamics are supplied by the Nucleous for European Modelling of the Ocean NEMO (v4.2) and include the representation of tides, while the wave component is provided by Wave Watch-III (v6.07) coupled through OASIS; the model solutions are corrected by a 3DVAR assimilation scheme (OceanVar) for temperature and salinity vertical profiles and along track satellite Sea Level Anomaly observations.\n\n''Product Citation'': Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing

                                                     \nMEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_006_017 is the nominal wave product of the Mediterranean Sea Forecasting system, composed by hourly wave parameters at 1/24\u00ba horizontal resolution covering the Mediterranean Sea and extending up to 18.125W into the Atlantic Ocean. The waves forecast component (Med-WAV system) is a wave model based on the WAM Cycle 6. The Med-WAV modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins and the model solutions are corrected by an optimal interpolation data assimilation scheme of all available along track satellite significant wave height observations. The atmospheric forcing is provided by the operational ECMWF Numerical Weather Prediction model and the wave model is forced with hourly averaged surface currents and sea level obtained from MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_006_013 at 1/24\u00b0 resolution. The model uses wave spectra for Open Boundary Conditions from GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_001_027 product. The wave system includes 2 forecast cycles providing twice per day a Mediterranean wave analysis and 10 days of wave forecasts.\n\n''Product Citation'': Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing

biogeochemical reanalysis at 1/24\u00b0 of horizontal resolution (ca. 4 km) covers the period from Jan 1999 to 1 month to the present and is produced by means of the MedBFM3 model system. MedBFM3, which is run by OGS (IT), includes the transport model OGSTM v4.0 coupled with the biogeochemical flux model BFM v5 and the variational data assimilation module 3DVAR-BIO v2.1 for surface chlorophyll. MedBFM3 is forced by the physical reanalysis (MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004 product run by CMCC) that provides daily forcing fields (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity, diffusivities, wind and solar radiation). The ESA-CCI database of surface chlorophyll concentration (CMEMS-OCTAC REP product) is assimilated with a weekly frequency. \n\nCossarini, G., Feudale, L., Teruzzi, A., Bolzon, G., Coidessa, G., Solidoro C., Amadio, C., Lazzari, P., Brosich, A., Di Biagio, V., and Salon, S., 2021.

description:'''\n\nMEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012  is the multi-year wave product of the Mediterranean Sea Waves forecasting system (Med-WAV). It contains a Reanalysis dataset, an Interim dataset covering the period after the reanalysis until 1 month before present and a monthly climatological dataset (reference period 1993-2016). The Reanalysis dataset is a multi-year wave reanalysis starting from January 1993, composed by hourly wave parameters at 1/24\u00b0 horizontal resolution, covering the Mediterranean Sea and extending up to 18.125W into the Atlantic Ocean. The Med-WAV modelling system is based on wave model WAM 4.6.2 and has been developed as a nested sequence of two computational grids (coarse and fine) to ensure that swell propagating from the North Atlantic (NA) towards the strait of Gibraltar is correctly entering the Mediterranean Sea. The coarse grid covers the North Atlantic Ocean from 75\u00b0W to 10\u00b0E and from 70\u00b0 N to 10\u00b0 S in 1/6\u00b0 resolution while the nested fine grid covers the Mediterranean Sea from 18.125\u00b0 W to 36.2917\u00b0 E and from 30.1875\u00b0 N to 45.9792\u00b0 N with a 1/24\u00b0 resolution. The modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins.  The wave system also includes an optimal interpolation assimilation scheme assimilating significant wave height along track satellite observations available through CMEMS and it is forced with daily averaged currents from Med-Physics and with 1-h, 0.25\u00b0 horizontal-resolution ERA5 reanalysis 10m-above-sea-surface winds from ECMWF.\n\n'''Product Citation''': \nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ

Description:'''\n\nThe ocean biogeochemistry reanalysis for the North-West European Shelf is produced using the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM), coupled online to the forecasting ocean assimilation model at 7 km horizontal resolution, NEMO-NEMOVAR. ERSEM (Butensch&ouml;n et al. 2016) is developed and maintained at Plymouth Marine Laboratory. NEMOVAR system was used to assimilate observations of sea surface chlorophyll concentration from ocean colour satellite data and all the physical variables described in [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009 NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009]. Biogeochemical boundary conditions and river inputs used climatologies; nitrogen deposition at the surface used time-varying data.\n\nThe description of the model and its configuration, including the products validation is provided in the [http://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-011.pdf CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-011]. \n\nProducts are provided as monthly and daily 25-hour, de-tided, averages. The datasets available are concentration of chlorophyll, nitrate, phosphate, oxygen, phytoplankton biomass, net primary production, light attenuation coefficient, pH, surface partial pressure of CO2, concentration of diatoms expressed as chlorophyll, concentration of dinoflagellates expressed as chlorophyll, concentration of nanophytoplankton expressed as chlorophyll, concentration of picophytoplankton expressed as chlorophyll in sea water. All, as multi-level variables, are interpolated from the model 51 hybrid s-sigma terrain-following system to 24 standard geopotential depths (z-levels). Grid-points near to the model boundaries are masked. The product is updated biannually,  providing a six-month extension of the time series. See [http://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/PUM/CMEMS-NWS-PUM-004-009_011.pdf CMEMS-NWS-PUM-004-009_011] for details.\n\n'''Associated products:'''\n\nThis model is coupled with a hydrodynamic model (NEMO) available as CMEMS product [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009 NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_PHY_004_009].\nAn

Description:'''\n\nThe ocean physics reanalysis for the North-West European Shelf is produced using an ocean assimilation model, with tides, at 7 km horizontal resolution.  \nThe ocean model is NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean), using the 3DVar NEMOVAR system to assimilate observations. These are surface temperature and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity. The model is forced by lateral boundary conditions from the GloSea5, one of the multi-models used by [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_026 GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_026] and at the Baltic boundary by the [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=BALTICSEA_REANALYSIS_PHY_003_011 BALTICSEA_REANALYSIS_PHY_003_011]. The atmospheric forcing is given by the ECMWF ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis. The river discharge is from a daily climatology. \n\nFurther details of the model, including the product validation are provided in the [http://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-009.pdf CMEMS-NWS-QUID-004-009]. \n\nProducts are provided as monthly and daily 25-hour, de-tided, averages. The datasets available are temperature, salinity, horizontal currents, sea level, mixed layer depth, and bottom temperature. Temperature, salinity and currents, as multi-level variables, are interpolated from the model 51 hybrid s-sigma terrain-following system to 24 standard geopotential depths (z-levels). Grid-points near to the model boundaries are masked. The product is updated biannually provinding six-month extension of the time series.\n\nSee [http://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/PUM/CMEMS-NWS-PUM-004-009_011.pdf CMEMS-NWS-PUM-004-009_011] for further details.\n\n'''Associated products:'''\n\nThis model is coupled with a biogeochemistry model (ERSEM) available as CMEMS product [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=NWSHELF_MULTIYEAR_BGC_004_011].

Consortium (Brockmann Consult, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) distributes Remote Sensing Reflectances (RRS, expressed in sr-1), Turbidity (TUR, expressed in FNU), Solid Particulate Matter Concentration (SPM, expressed in mg/l), spectral particulate backscattering (BBP, expressed in m-1) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, expressed in \u00b5g/l) for the Sentinel 2/MSI sensor at 100m resolution for a 20km coastal zone. The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n'''Description of observation methods/instruments:'''\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Consortium (Brockmann Consult, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) distributes Remote Sensing Reflectances (RRS, expressed in sr-1), Turbidity (TUR, expressed in FNU), Solid Particulate Matter Concentration (SPM, expressed in mg/l), spectral particulate backscattering (BBP, expressed in m-1) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, expressed in \u00b5g/l) for the Sentinel 2/MSI sensor at 100m resolution for a 20km coastal zone. The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided within 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n'''Description of observation methods/instruments:'''\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Consortium (Brockmann Consult, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) distributes Remote Sensing Reflectances (RRS, expressed in sr-1), Turbidity (TUR, expressed in FNU), Solid Particulate Matter Concentration (SPM, expressed in mg/l), spectral particulate backscattering (BBP, expressed in m-1) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, expressed in \u00b5g/l) for the Sentinel 2/MSI sensor at 100m resolution for a 20km coastal zone. The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult.

The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again.

Consortium (Brockmann Consult, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) distributes Remote Sensing Reflectances (RRS, expressed in sr-1), Turbidity (TUR, expressed in FNU), Solid Particulate Matter Concentration (SPM, expressed in mg/l), spectral particulate backscattering (BBP, expressed in m-1) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, expressed in \u00b5g/l) for the Sentinel 2/MSI sensor at 100m resolution for a 20km coastal zone. The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\u00b2. RRS and BBP are delivered at nominal central bands of 443, 492, 560, 665, 704, 740, 783, 865 nm. The primary variable from which it is virtually possible to derive all the geophysical and transparency products is the spectral RRS. This, together with the spectral BBP, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The spectral BBP product is generated from the RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). The NRT products are generally provided withing 24 hours up to 3 days after end of the day.The RRS product is accompanied by a relative uncertainty estimate (unitless) derived by direct comparison of the products to corresponding fiducial reference measurements provided through the AERONET-OC network. The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) for TUR, SPM and CHL: QI=(CurrentDataPixel-ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel where QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\n* Application of  a glint correction taking into account the detector viewing angles\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\n* invalid pixel identification takes into account  corrupted (L1) pixels, clouds, cloud shadow, glint, dry-fallen intertidal flats, coastal mixed-pixels, sea ice, melting ice, floating vegetation, non-water objects, and bottom reflection.\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\n\n'''Description of observation methods/instruments:'''\n\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\n\n'''Processing information:'''\n\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS BS Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00157", "instrument": null, "keywords": "black-sea,coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-bs-phy-subskin-l4-nrt-010-035:cmems-obs-sst-blk-phy-sst-nrt-diurnal-oi-0.0625deg-pt1h-m-202105,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-subskin-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2020-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Black Sea - High Resolution Diurnal Subskin Sea Surface Temperature Analysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_BS_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_013:SST_BS_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_013_a_202311": {"abstract": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Black Sea (BS), the CNR BS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) processing chain provides supercollated (merged multisensor, L3S) SST data remapped over the Black Sea at high (1/16\u00b0)  and Ultra High (0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, representative of nighttime SST values (00:00 UTC).

SSTfnd is defined within GHRSST as the temperature at the base of the diurnal thermocline. It is so named because it represents the foundation temperature on which the diurnal thermocline develops during the day. SSTfnd changes only gradually along with the upper layer of the ocean, and by definition it is independent of skin SST fluctuations due to wind- and radiation-dependent diurnal stratification or skin layer response. It is therefore updated at intervals of 24 hrs. SSTfnd corresponds to the temperature of the upper mixed layer which is the part of the ocean represented by the top-most layer of grid cells in most numerical ocean models. It is never observed directly by satellites, but it comes closest to being detected by infrared and microwave radiometers during the night, when the previous day's diurnal stratification can be assumed to have decayed.\n\nThe processing combines the observations of multiple polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, embedding infrared of microwave radiometers. All these sources are intercalibrated with each other before merging. A ranking procedure is used to select the best sensor observation for each grid point. An optimal interpolation is used to fill in where observations are missing.\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/mds-00321", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-glo-phy-l4-nrt-010-043:cmems-obs-sst-glo-phy-nrt-l4-p1d-m-202303,global-ocean,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2021-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "ODYSSEA Global Sea Surface Temperature Gridded Level 4 Daily Multi-Sensor Observations"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_GLO_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_010:IFREMER-GLOB-SST-L3-NRT-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE_202211": {"abstract": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Global Ocean- Sea Surface Temperature L3 Observations .

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS MED Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\n \n[https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-or-reference-copernicus-marine-products-and-services How to cite]\n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00170", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-phy-subskin-l4-nrt-010-036:cmems-obs-sst-med-phy-sst-nrt-diurnal-oi-0.0625deg-pt1h-m-202105,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-subskin-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2019-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea - High Resolution Diurnal Subskin Sea Surface Temperature Analysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012_a_202311": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012_a_202311", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-sst-l3s-nrt-observations-010-012:sst-med-sst-l3s-nrt-observations-010-012-a-202311,level-3,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-foundation-temperature,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea - High Resolution and Ultra High Resolution L3S Sea Surface Temperature"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012:SST_MED_SST_L3S_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_012_b_202311": {"abstract": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Mediterranean Sea (MED), the CNR MED Sea Surface Temperature (SST) processing chain provides supercollated (merged multisensor, L3S) SST data remapped over the Mediterranean Sea at high (1/16\u00b0)  and Ultra High (0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, representative of nighttime SST values (00:00 UTC).

Consequently, the L3S processing is run daily, but L3S files are produced only if valid SST measurements are present on the area considered. \n\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00171", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-sst-l3s-nrt-observations-010-012:sst-med-sst-l3s-nrt-observations-010-012-b-202311,level-3,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-foundation-temperature,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea - High Resolution and Ultra High Resolution L3S Sea Surface Temperature"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SSTA_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_b": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SSTA_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_b", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-sst-l4-nrt-observations-010-004:sst-med-ssta-l4-nrt-observations-010-004-b,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea High Resolution and Ultra High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Analysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SSTA_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_d": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SSTA_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_d", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-sst-l4-nrt-observations-010-004:sst-med-ssta-l4-nrt-observations-010-004-d,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea High Resolution and Ultra High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Analysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_a_V2_202311": {"abstract": "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_a_V2_202311", "instrument": null, "keywords": "coastal-marine-environment,eo:mo:dat:sst-med-sst-l4-nrt-observations-010-004:sst-med-sst-l4-nrt-observations-010-004-a-v2-202311,level-4,marine-resources,marine-safety,mediterranean-sea,near-real-time,not-applicable,oceanographic-geographical-features,satellite-observation,sea-surface-temperature,weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting", "license": ["Copernicus_Marine_Service_Product_License"], "missionEndDate": null, "missionStartDate": "2008-01-01", "platform": null, "platformSerialIdentifier": null, "processingLevel": null, "title": "Mediterranean Sea High Resolution and Ultra High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Analysis"}, "EO:MO:DAT:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004:SST_MED_SST_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_010_004_c_V2_202311": {"abstract": "'''Short description:''' \n\nFor the Mediterranean Sea (MED), the CNR MED Sea Surface Temperature (SST) processing chain provides daily gap-free (L4) maps at high (HR 0.0625\u00b0) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution over the Mediterranean Sea. Remotely-sensed L4 SST datasets are operationally produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR-GOS). These SST products are based on the nighttime images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms, and cover the Southern European Seas. The main upstream data currently used include SLSTR-3A/3B, VIIRS-N20/NPP, Metop-B/C AVHRR and SEVIRI. The CNR-GOS processing chain includes several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at high (HR 0.0625\u00b0) and ultra-high (UHR 0.01\u00b0) spatial resolution, applying statistical techniques. These L4 data are also used to estimate the SST anomaly with respect to a pentad climatology.

{"abstract": "'''Short description:'''\n\nFor the Global Ocean - The product contains hourly Level-4 sea surface wind and stress fields at 0.125 and 0.25 degrees horizontal spatial resolution. Scatterometer observations and their collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis model variables are used to calculate temporally-averaged difference fields. These fields are used to correct for persistent biases in hourly ECMWF ERA5 model fields. Bias corrections are based on scatterometer observations from Metop-A, Metop-B, Metop-C ASCAT (0.125 degrees) and QuikSCAT SeaWinds, ERS-1 and ERS-2 SCAT (0.25 degrees). The product provides stress-equivalent wind and stress variables as well as their divergence and curl.

Scatterometer observations for Metop-B and Metop-C ASCAT and their collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational model variables are used to calculate temporally-averaged difference fields. These fields are used to correct for persistent biases in hourly ECMWF operational model fields. The product provides stress-equivalent wind and stress variables as well as their divergence and curl.
