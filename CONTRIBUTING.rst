-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example`_ to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with
    your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
    was an exception.
-   List your Python and eodag versions. If possible, check if this
    issue is already fixed in the latest releases or the latest code in
    the repository.

Submitting patches
------------------

If you intend to contribute to eodag source code:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag.git
    cd eodag
    python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pre-commit isntall

To run the default test suite (which excludes end-to-end tests):

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

To only run end-to-end test:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -- tests.test_end_to_end

To run the entire tests (units, integraton and end-to-end):

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -- tests eodag

.. note::

    * Running the `tox` command will also build the docs. As The documentation
      includes some notebooks (for the turorials), the build process will need
      `pandoc <http://pandoc.org>`_ to succeed. If the build process fails for
      you, please `install <http://pandoc.org/installing.html>`_ pandoc and try
      again.

    * When contributing to tutorials, you will need to keep notebook outputs
      and save widget state. Otherwise outputs will not be visible in documentation.

    * eodag is tested against python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Ensure you have
      these versions installed before you run tox. You can use
      `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ to manage many different versions
      of python

Releases are made by tagging a commit on the master branch. To make a new release,

* Ensure you correctly updated `README.rst` and `CHANGES.rst` (and occasionally,
  also `NOTICE` - in case a new dependency is added).
* Check that the version string in `eodag/__meta__.py` (the variable `__version__`)
  is correctly updated
* Push your local master branch to remote.
* Tag the commit that represents the state of the release with a message. For example,
  for version 1.0, do this: `git tag -a v1.0 -m 'version 1.0'`
* Push the tags to github: `git push --tags`.

The documentation is managed by a webhook, and the latest documentation on readthedocs follows
the documentation present in `develop`. Therefore, there is nothing to do apart from updating
the `develop` branch to publish the latest documentation.
