    "- [EODAG-Cube](https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag-cube): Adds advanced data access and manipulation features using `Xarray`. It was been split to a separate project to avoid conflicts with unneeded libraries when using only EODAG basic functionalities.\n",
    "- [EODAG-Labextension](https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag-labextension): A JupyterLab extension that brings a friendly UI to your notebook and helps you search and browse for EO products using EODAG.\n",
    "- [STAC-FastAPI-EODAG](https://github.com/CS-SI/stac-fastapi-eodag): Makes EODAG available as a fully compliant [STAC API](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec), exposing its search and discovery features through a standard, interoperable interface..\n",
    "- [EO Catalog](https://github.com/csgroup-oss/eo-catalog): A production-grade catalog to process, store, and publish your remote-sensing imagery. When used with EODAG, it allows you to complement existing data provider offerings with your own datasets.\n",
