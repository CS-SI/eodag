       "  'abstract': \"The CH4_SCI_WFMD dataset comprises level 2, column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (mixing ratios) of methane (XCH4). It has been produced using data acquired from the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on board the European Space Agency's (ESA's) environmental research satellite ENVISAT, as part of the ESA's Greenhouse Gases Climate Change Initiative (GHG_cci) project.   This version of the data is version 4.0, and forms part of the Climate Research Data Package 4.The Weighting Function Modified DOAS (WFMD) algorithm is a least-squares method based on scaling pre-selected atmospheric vertical profiles. A second product is also available, which has been generated from the SCIAMACHY data using the IMAP algorithm. The data product is stored per day in separate NetCDF-files (NetCDF-4 classic model). The product files contain the key products and other information relevant for the use of the data e.g. the averaging kernels. Note that the results since November 2005 are considered to be of reduced quality in comparison to the earlier results because the extended-wavelength part (1590-1770 nm) of SCIAMACHY's channel 6, covering the methane 2v3 absorption band used for the methane retrieval, is subject to irreversible displacement damage induced by high energy solar protons, which occurs from time to time at individual detector pixels. Therefore several affected detector pixels had to be excluded for the time period since November 2005. For further information on the product, including details of the WFMD algorithm and the SCIAMACHY instrument, please see the associated product user guide (PUG) or the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents.\",\n",

(2020). It is on a 0.25 x 0.25 degree regular grid in latitude and longitude. It has recently been extended to 2020 within the RECCAP-2 project.For methane emission modeling, three water surface types are usually considered separately: the permanent water surfaces (such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs), the rice paddies, and the wetlands (i.e., the remaining water surfaces). As a consequence, the possibility to separate these contributions within the GIEMS pixels is required.

The data provide independently quantified sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to a quality suitable for climate research. This GHRSST (Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) dataset was produced by the ESA SST_cci project to facilitate comparison of its own spatially complete analyses with other level 4 SST analysis products. It provides the median and standard deviation of the ensemble of input analyses, differences between the individual analyses and the median, and gradients in the input data and the median. The outputs are provided on a 0.25Ë\\x9a regular latitude-longitude grid. The product extends from 1 September 1981 to 31 December 2016.The product was generated using the following inputs: ESA SST_cci Analysis version 2.0; ESA SST_cci Analysis version 1.1; E.U. Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) SST information (the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) Reprocessing); National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Optimal Interpolation (OI) Global Blended SST Analysis; Canada Meteorological Center (CMC) 0.2-degree Global Foundation SST Analysis; Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) Analysis version 2.2.0.0 (10 realisations); Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Merged satellite and in-situ Data Global Daily SST (MGDSST) Analysis.

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset provides the Gravitational Mass Balance (GMB) product derived from gravimetry data from the GRACE satellite instrument, by TU Dresden.  The data consists of two products: a mass change time series for the entire Greenland Ice Sheet and different drainage basins for the period April 2002 to August 2016; and mass trend grids for different 5-year periods between 2003 and 2016.   This version (1.3) is derived from GRACE monthly solutions from the CSR RL06 product.The mass change time series contains the mass change (with respect to a chosen reference month) for all of the Greenland Ice Sheet and each individual drainage basin.  For each month (defined by a decimal year) a mass change in Gt and its associated error (also in Gt) is provided.   The mass trend grid product is given in units of mm water equivalent per year.Mass balance is an important variable to understand glacial thinning and ablation rates to enable mapping glacier area change. The time series allows the longer term comparison of trends whereas the mass trend grids provide a yearly snapshot which can be further analysed and compared across the data set. Basin definitions and further data descriptions can be found in the Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Document (ST-DTU-ESA-GISCCI-ATBD-001_v3.1.pdf) and Product Specification Document (ST-DTU-ESA-GISCCI-PSD_v2.2.pdf) which are provided on the Greenland Ice Sheet CCI project website.

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset contains grounding lines for 5 North Greenland glaciers, derived from generated from ERS -1/-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry.  This version of the dataset (v1.3) has been extended with grounding lines for 2017. Data was produced as part of the ESA Greenland Ice Sheets Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project by ENVEO, Austria. The grounding line is the separation point between the floating and grounded parts of the glacier. Processes at the grounding lines of floating marine termini of glaciers and ice streams are important for understanding the response of the ice masses to changing boundary conditions and for establishing realistic scenarios for the response to climate change. The grounding line location product is derived from InSAR data by mapping the tidal flexure and is generated for a selection of the few glaciers in Greenland, which have a floating tongue. In general, the true location of the grounding line is unknown, and therefore validation is difficult for this product.Remote sensing observations do not provide direct measurement on the transition from floating to grounding ice (the grounding line). The satellite data deliver observations on ice surface features (e.g. tidal deformation by InSAR, spatial changes in texture and shading in optical images) that are indirect indicators for estimating the position of the grounding line. Due to the plasticity of ice these indicators spread out over a zone upstream and downstream of the grounding line, the tidal flexure zone (also called grounding zone).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This data set is part of the ESA Greenland Ice sheet CCI project. The data set provides surface elevation changes (SEC) for the Greenland Ice sheet derived from SARAL-AltiKa for 2013-2017. This new experimental product of surface elevation change is based on data from the AltiKa-instrument onboard the France (CNES)/Indian (ISRO) SARAL satellite. The AktiKa altimeter utilizes Ka-band radar signals, which have less penetration in the upper snow. However, the surface slope and roughness has an imprint in the derived signal and the new product is only available for the flatter central parts of the Greenland ice sheet.The corresponding SEC grid from Cryosat-2 is included for comparison. The algorithm used to devive the product is described in the paper â\\x80\\x9cImplications of changing scattering properties on the Greenland ice sheet volume change from Cryosat-2 altimetryâ\\x80\\x9d by S.B. Simonsen and L.S. SÃ¸rensen, Remote Sensing of the Environment, 190,pp.207-216, doi:10.1016/j.rse.2016.12.012.   The approach used here corresponds to Least Squares Method (LSM) 5 described in the paper, in which the slope within each grid cell is accounted for by subtraction of the GIMP DEM; the data are corrected for both backscatter and leading edge width; and the LSM is solved at 1 km grid resolution (2 km search radius) and averaged in the post-processing to 5 km grid resolution and with a correlation length of 20 km.',\n",

The detected lakes are presented as polygon vector features in shapefile format, with coordinates provided in the WGS 1984 UTM Zone 24N projected coordinate system. Ice marginal lakes were identified using three independent remote sensing methods: 1) multi-temporal backscatter classification from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery; 2) multi-spectral indices classification from Sentinel-2 optical imagery; and 3) sink detection from the ArcticDEM (v3). All data were compiled and filtered in a semi-automated approach, using a modified version of the MEaSUREs GIMP ice mask (https://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0714/versions/1) to clip the dataset to within 1 km of the ice margin. Each detected lake was then verified manually. The IIML was collected to better understand the impact of ice marginal lake change on the future sea level budget and the terrestrial and marine landscapes of Greenland, such as its ecosystems and human activities.The IIML is a complete inventory of Greenland, with no absent data.',\n",

The dataset is based on data from SPOT4/5-VEGETATION1/2 and PROBA-V as input data.LAI and fAPAR are retrieved using OptiSAIL (see Blessing and Giering, 2021 doi:10.20944/preprints202109.0147.v1). The dataset is processed for a north-south transect from Finland to South-Africa, as well as for a set of globally distributed sites that is representative for all biomes and for those sites where in-situ reference data is available.The temporal resolution of both datasets is 5 days, but is computed using data selected from a symmetric 10-days window. The data are not smoothed in time. The transect is ordered in tiles following the PROBA-V tiling definition. These files contain the fully validated layers of (effective) LAI, fAPAR, their uncertainties and the correlation between both. The sites additionally include the variables Chlorophyll a+b leaf pigment concentration (Cab), the fraction of Chlorophyll Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR_Cab) and Surface Albedo calculated as bi-hemispheric reflectance (BHR) for diffuse illumination with a reference spectrum for spectral broadband intervals visible wavelengths (VIS, 400-700 nm), near-infrared wavelengths (NIR, 700-2500 nm), and for the combined shortwave range (SW, 400-2500 nm), as well as directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) for the same spectral broadbands, computed for local solar noon.

The skin temperature is an important variable when considering surface fluxes of, for instance, heat and water.Daytime and night-time temperatures are provided in separate files corresponding to the morning and evening METOP-A equator crossing times which are 9.30 and 21:30 local solar time. Per pixel uncertainty estimates are given in two forms, first, an estimate of the total uncertainty for the pixel and second, a breakdown of the uncertainty into components by correlation length.

The skin temperature is an important variable when considering surface fluxes of, for instance, heat and water.Daytime and night-time temperatures are provided in separate files corresponding to 10:30 and 22:30 local solar time.

Also provided in the files, on a per pixel basis, are the observation time, the satellite viewing and solar geometry angles, a quality flag, and land cover class.The dataset is comprised of LSTs from a series of instruments with a common heritage: the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR-2), the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer on Sentinel 3A (SLSTRA); and data from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer on Earth Observation System - Terra (MODIS Terra) to fill the gap between AATSR and SLSTR. So, the instruments contributing to the time series are: ATSR-2 from August 1995 to July 2002; AATSR from August 2002 to March 2012; MODIS Terra from April 2012 to July 2016; and SLSTRA from August 2016 to December 2020. Inter-instrument biases are accounted for by cross-calibration with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments on Meteorological Operational (METOP) satellites. For consistency, a common algorithm is used for LST retrieval for all instruments. Furthermore, an adjustment is made to the LSTs to account for the half-hour difference between satellite equator crossing times. For consistency through the time series, coverage is restricted to the narrowest instrument swath width.The dataset coverage is near global over the land surface. During the period covered by ATSR-2, small regions were not covered due to downlinking constraints (most noticeably a track extending southwards across central Asia through India â\\x80\\x93 further details can be found on the ATSR project webpages at http://www.atsr.rl.ac.uk/dataproducts/availability/coverage/atsr-2/index.shtml).LSTs are provided on a global equal angle grid at a resolution of 0.01Â° longitude and 0.01Â° latitude. Full Earth coverage is achieved in 3 days so the daily files have gaps where the surface is not covered by the satellite swath on that day.

LSTs are provided on a global equal angle grid at a resolution of 0.05Â° longitude and 0.05Â° latitude. The dataset coverage is nominally global over the land surface but varies depending on satellite and instrument availability and coverage. Furthermore, LSTs are not produced where clouds are present since under these circumstances the IR radiometer observes the cloud top which is usually much colder than the surface.The dataset was produced by the University of Leicester (UoL) and data were processed in the UoL processing chain. The Geostationary data were produced by the Instituto PortuguÃªs do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) before being merged into the final dataset.The dataset was produced as part of the ESA Land Surface Temperature Climate Change Initiative which strives to improve satellite datasets to Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) standards.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset contains Global Plant Functional Types (PFT) data, from the ESA Medium Resolution Land Cover (MRLC) Climate Change Initiative project.   The data provides yearly data, and initially covers the time period from 1992 to 2020.   It is anticipated that the dataset will be updated annually going forward.The PFT v2.0.8 global dataset has 14 layers, each describing the percentage cover (0-100%) of a plant functional type at a spatial resolution of 300 m: broadleaved evergreen trees, broadleaved deciduous trees, needleleaved evergreen trees, needleleaved deciduous trees, broadleaved evergreen shrubs, broadleaved deciduous shrubs, needleleaved evergreen shrubs, needleleaved deciduous shrubs, natural grasses, herbaceous cropland (i.e., managed grasses), built, water, bare areas, and snow and ice.\"Plant Functional Typesâ\\x80\\x9d (PFTs) refer to globally representative and similarly behaving plant types. PFTs can be related to physiognomy and phenology, climate (which defines the geographical ranges in which a plant type can grow and reproduce under natural conditions, and physiological activity (e.g., C3/C4 photosynthetic pathways).All terrestrial zones of the Earth between the parallels 90Â°N and 90Â°S are covered. The PFT dataset has a regular latitude-longitude grid with a grid spacing of 0.002777777777778Â°, corresponding to ~300 m at the equator and ~200 m in the midlatitudes.    The Coordinate Reference System used for the global land cover database is a geographic coordinate system (GCS) based on the World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) reference ellipsoid.The plant functional type (PFT) distribution was created by combining auxiliary data products with the CCI MRLC map series. The LC classification provides the broad characteristics of the 300 m pixel, including the expected vegetation form(s) (tree, shrub, grass) and/or abiotic land type(s) (water, bare area, snow and ice, built-up) in the pixel. For some classes, the class legend specifies an expected range for the fractional covers of the contributing PFTs and broadly differentiates between natural and cultivated vegetation. We used a quantitative, globally consistent method that fuses the 300-metre MRLC product with a suite of existing high-resolution datasets to develop spatially explicit annual maps of PFT fractional composition at 300 metres. The new PFT product exhibits intraclass spatial variability in PFT fractional cover at the 300-metre pixel level and is complementary to the MRLC maps since the derived PFT fractions maintain consistency with the original LC class legend. This dataset was generated to reduce the cross-walking component of uncertainty by adding spatial variability to the PFT composition within a LC class. This work moved beyond fine-tuning the cross-walking approach for specific LC classes or regions and, instead, separately quantifies the PFT fractional composition for each 300 m pixel globally. The result is a dataset representing the cover fractions of 14 PFTs at 300 m for each year within the time range, consistent with the CCI MRLC LC maps for the corresponding year.This study was carried out with the continued support of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative under the contract ESA/No.4000126564 Land_Cover_cci.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 5.0) is a global inventory of glacier outlines. It is supplemental to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space initiative (GLIMS). Production of the RGI was motivated by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). Future updates will be made to the RGI and the GLIMS Glacier Database in parallel during a transition period. As all these data are incorporated into the GLIMS Glacier Database and as download tools are developed to obtain GLIMS data in the RGI data format, the RGI will evolve into a downloadable subset of GLIMS, offering complete one-time coverage, version control, and a standard set of attributes.The product provided here is a converted raster version of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 5.0) data, provided by the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Glaciers project.

Snow cover fraction on ground (SCFG) indicates the area of snow observed from space over land surfaces, in forested areas corrected for the transmissivity of the forest canopy.

The coastal zones of Greenland are included.The SCFG time series provides daily products for the period 1982-2018. The product is based on medium resolution optical satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Clouds are masked using the Cloud CCI cloud v3.0 mask product. The retrieval method of the snow_cci SCFG product from AVHRR data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by MetsÃ¤mÃ¤ki et al.

All cloud free pixels are then used for the snow extent mapping, using spectral bands centred at about 0.63 Âµm and 1.61 Âµm (channel 3a or the reflective part of channel 3b (ref3b)), and an emissive band centred at about 10.8 Âµm. The snow_cci snow cover mapping algorithm is a three-step approach: first, a strict pre-classification is applied to identify all cloud free pixels which are certainly snow free. For all remaining pixels, the snow_cci SCFG retrieval method is applied. Finally, a post-processing removes erroneous snow pixels caused either by falsely classified clouds in the tropics or by unreliable ref3b values at a global scale.

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset contains Daily Snow Cover Fraction (snow on ground) from AVHRR, produced by the Snow project of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme. Snow cover fraction on ground (SCFG) indicates the area of snow observed from space over land surfaces, in forested areas corrected for the transmissivity of the forest canopy. The SCFG is given in percentage (%) per pixel. The global SCFG product is available at about 5 km pixel size for all land areas, excluding Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets. The coastal zones of Greenland are included.The SCFG time series provides daily products for the period 1979-2022. The product is based on medium resolution optical satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Clouds are masked using the CLARA-A3 cloud product. The retrieval method of the snow_cci SCFG product from AVHRR data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by MetsÃ¤mÃ¤ki et al. (2015) and complemented with a pre-classification module. All cloud free pixels are then used for the snow extent mapping, using spectral bands centred at about 0.63 Âµm and 1.61 Âµm (channel 3a or the reflective part of channel 3b (ref3b)), and an emissive band centred at about 10.8 Âµm. The snow_cci snow cover mapping algorithm is a three-step approach: first, a strict pre-classification is applied to identify all cloud free pixels which are certainly snow free. For all remaining pixels, the snow_cci SCFG retrieval method is applied. Finally, a post-processing removes erroneous snow pixels caused either by falsely classified clouds in the tropics or by unreliable ref3b values at a global scale. The following auxiliary data sets are used for product generation: i) ESA CCI Land Cover from 2000; water bodies and permanent snow and ice areas are masked based on this dataset. Both classes were separately aggregated to the pixel spacing of the SCF product. Water areas are masked if more than 50 percent of the pixel is classified as water, permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50 percent are identified as such areas in the aggregated map; ii) Forest canopy transmissivity map; this layer is based on the tree cover classes of the ESA CCI Land Cover 2000 data set and the tree cover density map from Landsat data for the year 2000 (Hansen et al., Science, 2013, DOI: 10.1126/science.1244693). This layer is used to apply a forest canopy correction and estimate in forested areas the fractional snow cover on ground.The SCFG product is aimed to serve the needs of users working in cryosphere and climate research and monitoring activities, including the detection of variability and trends, climate modelling and aspects of hydrology, meteorology, and biology.The Remote Sensing Research Group of the University of Bern, in cooperation with Gamma Remote Sensing is responsible for the SCFG product development and generation.

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset contains the CryoClim Daily Snow Cover Fraction (snow on ground) product, produced by the Snow project of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme.Fractional snow cover (FSC) on the ground indicates the area of snow observed from space on land surfaces, in forested areas compensated for the effect of trees hiding the ground surface snow cover under the forest canopy. The FSC is given in percentage (%) per grid cell. The global snow_cci CryoClim fractional snow cover (FSC) product is available at 0.05Â° grid size (about 5 km) for all land areas, excluding Antarctica and Greenland ice sheet. The coastal zones of Greenland are included. The CryoClim FSC time series provides daily products for the period 1982 â\\x80\\x93 2019. The CryoClim FSC product is based on a multi-sensor time-series fusion algorithm combining observations by optical and passive microwave radiometer (PMR) data. The product combines an historical record of AVHRR sensor data with PMR data from the SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS sensors. The overall aim of the CryoClim FSC climate data record is to provide one of the longest snow cover extent time series available with global coverage and without hindrance from clouds and polar night. This has been achieved by utilising the best features of optical and passive microwave radiometer observations of snow using a sensor-fusion algorithm generating a consistent time series of global FSC products (Solberg et al. 2014, 2015; Rudjord et al. 2015). The snow_cci project has advanced the original CryoClim binary product to an FSC product. The thematic variable represents snow on the ground (SCFG). AVHRR sensors aboard the satellites NOAA-7, -9, -11, -14, -16, -18, -19 have been used as the optical data source, and SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS sensors aboard the Nimbus-7, DMSP F8, DMSP F10, DMSP F11, DMSP F13, DMSP F14, DMSP F15, DMSP F16, DMSP F17 and DMSP F18 satellites, respectively, have been used as PMR data source. To have the best possible input data quality, we have used fundamental climate data records (FCDRs) developed by EUMETSAT CM SAF for AVHRR (Karlson et al. 2020) and PMR (Fenning et al. 2017).The optical algorithm component processes all available swaths from AVHRR GAC. The calculations are based on a Bayesian approach using a set of signatures (instrument channel combinations) and statistical coefficients. For each pixel of the swath, the probabilities for the surface classes snow, bare ground and cloud are estimated. The statistical coefficients are based on pre-knowledge of the typical behaviour of the surface classes in the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.The algorithm for PMR is also based on a Bayesian estimation approach. For SSM/I and SSMIS four snow classes were defined to model the snow surface state. For SMMR two classes were considered. The algorithm estimates the probability for each snow class given the PMR measurements. Land cover data are included to improve the performance of the Bayesian algorithm. This made it possible to construct a Bayesian estimator for each land cover regime. The multi-sensor multi-temporal fusion algorithm (Rudjord et al. 2015; Solberg et al. 2017) is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) simulating the snow states based on observations with PMR and optical sensors. The basic idea is to simulate the states the snow surface goes through during the snow season with a state model. The states are not directly observable, but the remote sensing observations give data describing the snow conditions, which are related to the snow states. The HMM solution represents not only a multi-sensor model but also a multi-temporal model. The sequence of states over time is conditioned to follow certain optimisation criteria.The advancement from binary to fractional snow cover carried out by snow_cci has followed two main paths: First, we introduced more HMM states to be able to classify the snow cover into 10% FSC intervals. However, introducing 100 primary states to obtain 1% FSC intervals would not give a stable model. For obtaining higher precision, we have interpolated between HMM states using a secondary Viterbi sequence. The two probabilities are used as weights to estimate the FSC.Permanent snow and ice, and water areas are masked based on the Land Cover CCI data set of the year 2000. Both classes were separately aggregated to the grid size of the FSC product. Water areas are masked if more than 30% of the grid cell is classified as water, permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50% is identified as such areas in the aggregated map. The product uncertainty for observed land areas is provided as unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) per grid cell in the ancillary variable.The FSC product aims to serve the needs of users working with the cryosphere and climate research and monitoring activities, including the assessment of variability and trends, climate modelling and aspects of hydrology, meteorology, and biology.The Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral, NR) is together with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) responsible for the FSC product development and generation from satellite data. ENVEO IT GmbH developed and prepared all auxiliary data sets used for the product generation.For the whole time series, there are 27 days with neither optical nor PMR retrieval. These are individual days and not series of days in a row. The multi-sensor time-series algorithm handles this by making a best estimate of snow cover, based on days both prior to and following after the lack of data. This will not reduce the quality of the snow maps much for days without data as long as they are just individual days.The algorithm estimating the uncertainty associated with the FSC maps needs observations of covariates from the same day as the time stamp of the FSC product. These covariates are partly based on data from PMR sensors. Hence, estimates of uncertainty could not be produced for days lacking PMR acquisitions. Most days lacking PMR are in the period 1982-1988 (53 days), and there are only two cases after that (in 2008).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This dataset contains Daily Snow Cover Fraction of viewable snow from AVHRR, produced by the Snow project of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme.  Snow cover fraction viewable (SCFV) indicates the area of snow viewable from space over land surfaces. In forested areas this refers to snow viewable on top of the forest canopy. The SCFV is given in percentage (%) per pixel. The global SCFV product is available at about 5 km pixel size for all land areas, excluding Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets. The coastal zones of Greenland are included.The SCFV time series provides daily products for the period 1982-2018. The product is based on medium resolution optical satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Clouds are masked using the Cloud CCI cloud v3.0 mask product. The retrieval method of the snow_cci SCFV product from AVHRR data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by MetsÃ¤mÃ¤ki et al. (2015) and complemented with a pre- and post-classification module. All cloud free pixels are then used for the snow extent mapping, using spectral bands centred at about 0.630 Âµm and 1.61 Âµm (channel 3a or the reflective part of channel 3b (ref3b)), and an emissive band centred at about 10.8 Âµm. The snow_cci snow cover mapping algorithm is a three-step approach: first, a strict pre-classification is applied to identify all cloud free pixels which are certainly snow free. For all remaining pixels, the snow_cci SCFV retrieval method is applied.  Finally, a post-processing removes erroneous snow pixels caused either by falsely classified clouds in the tropics or by unreliable ref3b values at a global scale. The following auxiliary data set is used for product generation: ESA CCI Land Cover from 2000; water bodies and permanent snow and ice areas are masked based on this dataset. Both classes were separately aggregated to the pixel spacing of the SCF product. Water areas are masked if more than 50 percent of the pixel is classified as water; permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50 percent are identified as such areas in the aggregated map.The SCFV product is aimed to serve the needs for users working in the cryosphere and climate research and monitoring activities, including the detection of variability and trends, climate modelling and aspects of hydrology, meteorology and biology.The Remote Sensing Research Group of the University of Bern is responsible for the SCFV product development and generation. ENVEO developed and prepared all auxiliary data sets used for the product generation. The SCFV AVHRR product comprises one longer data gap of 92 between November 1994 and January 1995, and 16 individual daily gaps, resulting in a 99% data coverage over the entire study period of 37 years.',\n",

The retrieval method of the Snow_cci SCFV product from MODIS data has been further developed and improved based on the ESA GlobSnow approach described by MetsÃ¤mÃ¤ki et al.

(2015) are (i) improvements of the cloud screening approach applicable on a global scale, (ii) the pre-classification of snow free areas on global land areas, (iii) the adaptation of the retrieval method using of a spatially variable ground reflectance instead of global constant values for snow free land, (iv) the update of the constant value for wet snow based on analyses of spatially distributed reflectance time series of MODIS data to assure in forested areas consistency of the SCFV and the SCFG CRDP v2.0 from MODIS data (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/ebe625b6f77945a68bda0ab7c78dd76b) using the same retrieval approach.Improvements of the Snow_cci SCFV version 2.0 compared to the Snow_cci version 1.0 include (i) the utilisation of an updated ground reflectance map derived from statistical analyses of an extended MODIS time series, (ii) an update of the forest mask used for the transmissivity estimation, and (iii) an update of the constant reflectance value for wet snow based on the analysis of time series of the MODIS reflectance at 0.55 Âµm.Permanent snow and ice, and water areas are masked based on the Land Cover CCI data set of the year 2000. Both classes were separately aggregated to the pixel spacing of the SCFV product. Water areas are masked if more than 30 percent of the pixel is classified as water, permanent snow and ice areas are masked if more than 50 percent are identified as such areas in the aggregated map.

       "  'abstract': \"MW-LST is a data record of land surface temperature (LST) derived from the microwave instruments Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager / Sounder (SSMIS). Observations available at frequencies close to 18, 22, 26, and 85 GHz are used as an input to a retrieval algorithm that produces LST over all continental surfaces, twice per day (6 am/pm), at a spatial resolution of ~25 km, and over 25 years (1996-2020). The data record has been produced by the company Estellus working within the ESA Land Surface Temperature Climate Change Initiative (LST_cci).   Compared with the remaining infrared LST data records of the LST_cci, the spatial resolution of the MW-LST is coarser, and the associated retrieval errors are larger. However, it offers LST estimates for clear-sky and cloudy conditions, therefore complementing the IR LST data records, which can only provide LST for clear skies. The data record is temporally and spatially complete, although in rare occasions some data can be missing due to missing observations, e.g., due to satellite maintenance operations or anomalous behavior. The data record is provided on a regular grid of 0.25x0.25 degrees, saved as daily, monthly, and yearly netcdf files. The reader is referred to the LST_cci website for more information about how the data record was derived, and how to use the data and associated quality flags and estimated uncertainty.This version of the data is v2.33.   It fixes an issue that was found with the variable 'lst_unc_time_correction' in the previous v2.23, but is otherwise identical.\",\n",

The SWE product time series covers the period from 1979/01 to 2020/05. Northern Hemisphere SWE products are available at daily temporal resolution with alpine areas masked. The product is based on data from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) operated on National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ\\x80\\x99s (NASA) Nimbus-7 satellite, the  Special Sensor Microwave / Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager / Sounder (SSMI/S) carried onboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) 5D- and F-series satellites. The satellite bands provide spatial resolutions between 15 and 69 km.  The retrieval methodology combines satellite passive microwave radiometer (PMR) measurements with ground-based synoptic weather station observations by Bayesian non-linear iterative assimilation. A background snow-depth field from re-gridded surface snow-depth observations and a passive microwave emission model are required components of the retrieval scheme.The dataset is aimed to serve the needs of users working on climate research and monitoring activities, including the detection of variability and trends, climate modelling, and aspects of hydrology and meteorology.The Finnish Meteorological Institute is responsible for the SWE product development and generation. For the period from 1979 to May 1987, the products are available every second day. From October 1987 till May 2020, the products are available daily. Products are only generated for the Northern Hemisphere winter seasons, usually from beginning of October till the middle of May. A limited number of SWE products are available for days in June and September; products are not available for the months July and August as there is usually no snow information reported on synoptic weather stations, which is required as input for the SWE retrieval. Because of known limitations in alpine terrain, a complex-terrain mask is applied based on the sub-grid variability in elevation determined from a high-resolution digital elevation model. All land ice and large lakes are also masked; retrievals are not produced for coastal regions of Greenland.This version 2 dataset has some notable differences compared to the v1 data. In v2, passive microwave radiometer data are obtained from the recalibrated enhanced resolution CETB ESDR dataset  (MEaSUREs Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Passive Microwave Daily EASE-Grid 2.0 Brightness Temperature (CETB) Earth System Data Record (ESDR)  https://nsidc.org/pmesdr/data-sets/), the grid spacing is reduced from 25 km to 12.5 km, and spatially and temporally varying snow density fields are used to adjust SWE retrievals in post processing. The output grid spacing is reduced from 0.25-degree to 0.10-degree WGS84 latitude / longitude to be compatible with other Snow_cci products. The time series has been extended by two years with data from 2018 to 2020 added.The ESA CCI phased product development framework allowed for a systematic analysis of these changes to the input data and snow density parameterization that occurred between v1 and v2 using a series of step-wise developmental datasets. In comparison with in-situ snow courses, the correlation and RMSE of v2 improved 18% (0.1) and 12% (5mm), respectively, relative to v1. The timing of peak snow mass is shifted two weeks later and a temporal discontinuity in the monthly northern hemisphere snow mass time series associated with the shift from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) in 2009 is removed in v2.',\n",

The skin temperature is an important variable when considering surface fluxes of, for instance, heat and water.Daytime and night-time temperatures are provided in separate files corresponding to the morning and evening Terra equator crossing times which are 10:30 and 22:30 local solar time. Per pixel uncertainty estimates are given in two forms, first, an estimate of the total uncertainty for the pixel and second, a breakdown of the uncertainty into components by correlation length.

LSTs are provided on a global equal angle grid at a resolution of 0.01Â° longitude and 0.01Â° latitude. MODIS achieves full Earth coverage nearly twice per day so the daily files have small gaps primarily close to the equator where the surface is not covered by the satellite swath on that day. Furthermore, LSTs are not produced where clouds are present since under these circumstances the IR radiometer observes the cloud top which is usually much colder than the surface.Dataset coverage starts on 24th February 2000 and ends on 31st December 2018.

It provides assessments of the global mean sea level and ocean mass budgets.  Assessment of the global mean sea level budget means to assess how well (a) agrees, within uncertainties, to the sum of (b) and (c) or to the sum of (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g). Assessment of the ocean mass budget means to assess how well (c) agrees to the sum (d), (e), (f) and (g).All time series are expressed in terms of anomalies (in millimetres of equivalent global mean sea level) with respect to the mean value over the 10-year reference period 2006-2015. The temporal resolution is monthly. The temporal range is from January 1993 to December 2016. Some time series do not cover this full temporal range. All time series are complete over the temporal range from January 2003 to August 2016.For some elements, more than one time series are given, as a result of different assessments from different data sources and methods.Data and methods underlying the time series are as follows:(a) satellite altimetry analysis by the Sea Level CCI project.(b) a new analysis of Argo drifter data with incorporation of sea surface temperature data; an alternative time series consists in an ensemble mean over previous global mean steric sea level anomaly time series.(c) analysis of monthly global gravity field solutions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravimetry mission.(d) results from a global glacier model.(e) analysis of satellite radar altimetry over the Greenland Ice Sheet, amended by results from the global glacier model for the Greenland peripheral glaciers; an alternative time series consists of results from GRACE satellite gravimetry.(f) analysis of satellite radar altimetry over the Antarctic Ice Sheet; an alternative time series consists of results from GRACE satellite gravimetry.(g) results from the WaterGAP global hydrological model.Version 2.2 is an update of the previous Version 2.1.

This microseism dataset is version 1.0, and forms part of the v3 release from the ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative.Microseism data is a new addition to this CCI Sea State version 3 Dataset. Microseisms are well known to contain rich spectral information about sea states and have been used as early as 1898 to locate typhoons . As such they are unique sources of information on sea states before the advent of surface-following buoys and satellites, with the potential to define long-term trends alongside Voluntary Observing Ship data . Microseisms can be a useful resource when looking for the occurrence of wave events or investigating trends, in particular in regions where no in situ data is available. The data here are spectra of vertical ground displacement at all the available land-based stations from 3 global seismic networks (Geoscope, IRIS USGS and IRIS IDA) from 1988 to 2019. So far microseism data was either handled by seismologists with specific data formats or processed by oceanographers with limited knowledge of the measurement (such as instrument corrections); in the frame of the CCI Sea State project, they have been transformed into yearly NetCDF files containing the seismic spectrograms (Power Spectral Density of displacement) for each station using the â\\x80\\x9cLHZâ\\x80\\x9d channel (vertical displacement sampled at 1 Hz). Note that some of these stations have recordings (with different instruments and stored on different media) that go back to the early part of the 20th century, hence their possible importance for extending climate time series to the pre-satellite era in a future release.',\n",

This dataset is one of the 6 datasets generated in Cloud_cci; all of them being based on passive-imager satellite measurements.This dataset is based on measurements from AVHRR (onboard the NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, NOAA-16, NOAA-18, NOAA-19 satellites) and contains a variety of cloud properties which were derived employing the Community Cloud retrieval for Climate (CC4CL; Sus et al., 2018; McGarragh et al., 2018) retrieval framework. The core cloud properties contained in the Cloud_cci AVHRR-PMv3 dataset are cloud mask/fraction, cloud phase, cloud top pressure/height/temperature, cloud optical thickness, cloud effective radius and cloud liquid/ice water path. Spectral cloud albedo is also included as experimental product. The cloud properties are available at different processing levels: This particular dataset contains Level-3C (monthly averages and histograms) data, while Level-3U (globally gridded, unaveraged data fields) is also available as a separate dataset.

Altimeter along-track sea level measurements from the RA2 instrument on ENVISAT and the Altika instrument on SARAL satellite missions have been processed to produce high resolution (20 Hz, corresponding to an along-track distance of ~300m) sea level anomalies, in order to provide long-term homogeneous sea level time series as close to the coast as possible in six different coastal regions (North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Western Africa, North Indian Ocean, South-East Asia and Australia).  The product benefits from the spatial resolution provided by high-rate data, the Adaptive Leading Edge Subwaveform Retracker (ALES) and the post-processing strategy of the along-track (X-TRACK) algorithm, both developed for the processing of coastal altimetry data, as well as the best possible set of geophysical corrections.  The main objective of this product is to provide accurate altimeter Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) time series as close to the coast as possible in order to assess whether the coastal sea level trends experienced at the coast are similar to the observed sea level trends in the open ocean and to determine the causes of the potential discrepancies.The Envisat and SARAL/AltiKa missions have the same ground track but the temporal gap between both missions prevents from computing reliable trends during the total period between both missions.This dataset has been produced by the Climate Change Initiative Coastal Sea Level team, within the extension phase of the European Sapce Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative.',\n",

Up to now, satellite altimetry has provided global gridded sea level time series up to 10-15 km from the coast only, preventing the estimation of how sea level changes very close to the coast on interannual to decadal time scales. This dataset has been derived from a new version of the ESA SL_cci+  dataset of coastal sea level anomalies which is based on the reprocessing of raw radar altimetry waveforms from the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions to derive satellite-sea surface ranges as close as possible to the coast (a process called â\\x80\\x98retrackingâ\\x80\\x99) and optimization of the geophysical corrections applied to the range measurements to produce sea level time series.This large amount of coastal sea level estimates has been further analysed to produce the present dataset: a total of 756 altimetry-based virtual coastal stations have been selected and sea level anomalies time series together with associated coastal sea level trends have been computed over the study time span. The main objective of this dataset is to analyze the sea level trends close to the coast and compare them with the sea level trends observed in the open ocean and to determine the causes of the potential differences.The product has been developed within the sea level project of the extension phase of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (SL_cci+).

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital & dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)',</td>\n",

These files are 5 day composites of merged sensor (MERIS, MODIS Aqua, SeaWiFS LAC &amp; GAC, VIIRS, OLCI) products.  MODIS Aqua and SeaWiFS were band-shifted and bias-corrected to MERIS bands and values using a temporally and spatially varying scheme based on the overlap years of 2003-2007.  VIIRS was band-shifted and bias-corrected in a second stage against the MODIS Rrs that had already been corrected to MERIS levels, for the overlap period 2012-2014; at the third stage Sentinel-3A OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected MODIS, for overlap period 2016-07-01 to 2019-06-30;  at the fourth stage Sentinel-3B OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected Sentinel-3A OLCI, for overlap period 2018-07-01 to 2021-06-30.  VIIRS, MODIS, SeaWiFS and MERIS Rrs were derived from a combination of NASA&#x27;s l2gen (for basic sensor geometry corrections, etc) and HYGEOS POLYMER (for atmospheric correction). OLCI Rrs were sourced at L1b (already geometrically corrected) and processed with POLYMER.  The Rrs were binned to a sinusoidal 4km level-3 grid, and later to 4km geographic projection, by Brockmann Consult&#x27;s SNAP.  Derived products were generally computed with the standard algorithms through SeaDAS.  QAA IOPs were derived using the standard SeaDAS algorithm but with a modified backscattering table to match that used in the bandshifting.  The final chlorophyll is a combination of OCI, OCI2, OC2 and OCx, depending on the water class memberships.  Uncertainty estimates were added using the fuzzy water classifier and uncertainty estimation algorithm of Tim Moore as documented in Jackson et al (2017). and updated according to Jackson et al.

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the &#x27;All Products&#x27; dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital &amp; dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)</dd><dt><span>instrument :</span></dt><dd>MODIS</dd><dt><span>missionStartDate :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>platformSerialIdentifier :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>processingLevel :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>productType :</span></dt><dd>024292dcda5d42ceb326850f89f8b40d</dd><dt><span>modificationDate :</span></dt><dd>2023-04-24T16:51:29</dd><dt><span>startTimeFromAscendingNode :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</dd><dt><span>completionTimeFromAscendingNode :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-15T23:59:00+00:00</dd><dt><span>downloadLink :</span></dt><dd>https://fedeo.ceos.org/collections/024292dcda5d42ceb326850f89f8b40d/items/d745e825623b7824d0b762a88545d851f93eaf08?httpAccept=application/geo%2Bjson;profile=https://stacspec.org</dd><dt><span>storageStatus :</span></dt><dd>ONLINE</dd><dt><span>start_datetime :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>\n",

These files are 5 day composites of merged sensor (MERIS, MODIS Aqua, SeaWiFS LAC &amp; GAC, VIIRS, OLCI) products.  MODIS Aqua and SeaWiFS were band-shifted and bias-corrected to MERIS bands and values using a temporally and spatially varying scheme based on the overlap years of 2003-2007.  VIIRS was band-shifted and bias-corrected in a second stage against the MODIS Rrs that had already been corrected to MERIS levels, for the overlap period 2012-2014; at the third stage Sentinel-3A OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected MODIS, for overlap period 2016-07-01 to 2019-06-30;  at the fourth stage Sentinel-3B OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected Sentinel-3A OLCI, for overlap period 2018-07-01 to 2021-06-30.  VIIRS, MODIS, SeaWiFS and MERIS Rrs were derived from a combination of NASA&#x27;s l2gen (for basic sensor geometry corrections, etc) and HYGEOS POLYMER (for atmospheric correction). OLCI Rrs were sourced at L1b (already geometrically corrected) and processed with POLYMER.  The Rrs were binned to a sinusoidal 4km level-3 grid, and later to 4km geographic projection, by Brockmann Consult&#x27;s SNAP.  Derived products were generally computed with the standard algorithms through SeaDAS.  QAA IOPs were derived using the standard SeaDAS algorithm but with a modified backscattering table to match that used in the bandshifting.  The final chlorophyll is a combination of OCI, OCI2, OC2 and OCx, depending on the water class memberships.  Uncertainty estimates were added using the fuzzy water classifier and uncertainty estimation algorithm of Tim Moore as documented in Jackson et al (2017). and updated according to Jackson et al.

Note,  the IOP data are also included in the &#x27;All Products&#x27; dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital &amp; dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)</dd><dt><span>instrument :</span></dt><dd>MODIS</dd><dt><span>missionStartDate :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>platformSerialIdentifier :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>processingLevel :</span></dt><dd>None</dd><dt><span>productType :</span></dt><dd>024292dcda5d42ceb326850f89f8b40d</dd><dt><span>modificationDate :</span></dt><dd>2023-04-24T16:51:29</dd><dt><span>startTimeFromAscendingNode :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</dd><dt><span>completionTimeFromAscendingNode :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-15T23:59:00+00:00</dd><dt><span>downloadLink :</span></dt><dd>https://fedeo.ceos.org/collections/024292dcda5d42ceb326850f89f8b40d/items/d745e825623b7824d0b762a88545d851f93eaf08?httpAccept=application/geo%2Bjson;profile=https://stacspec.org</dd><dt><span>storageStatus :</span></dt><dd>ONLINE</dd><dt><span>start_datetime :</span></dt><dd>2008-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"
