AG_ERA5,"This dataset provides daily surface meteorological data for the period from 1979 to present as input for agriculture and agro-ecological studies. This dataset is based on the hourly ECMWF ERA5 data at surface level and is referred to as AgERA5. Acquisition and pre-processing of the original ERA5 data is a complex and specialized job. By providing the AgERA5 dataset, users are freed from this work and can directly start with meaningful input for their analyses and modelling. To this end, the variables provided in this dataset match the input needs of most agriculture and agro-ecological models. Data were aggregated to daily time steps at the local time zone and corrected towards a finer topography at a 0.1째 spatial resolution. The correction to the 0.1째 grid was realized by applying grid and variable-specific regression equations to the ERA5 dataset interpolated at 0.1째 grid. The equations were trained on ECMWF's operational high-resolution atmospheric model (HRES) at a 0.1째 resolution. This way the data is tuned to the finer topography, finer land use pattern and finer land-sea delineation of the ECMWF HRES model.

CAMS_EAC4,"EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) is the fourth generation ECMWF global reanalysis of atmospheric composition. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. The assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates.

CAMS_EU_AIR_QUALITY_FORECAST,"This dataset provides daily air quality analyses and forecasts for Europe. CAMS produces specific daily air quality analyses and forecasts for the European domain at significantly higher spatial resolution (0.1 degrees, approx. 10km) than is available from the global analyses and forecasts. The production is based on an ensemble of eleven air quality forecasting systems across Europe. A median ensemble is calculated from individual outputs, since ensemble products yield on average better performance than the individual model products. The spread between the eleven models are used to provide an estimate of the forecast uncertainty. The analysis combines model data with observations provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) into a complete and consistent dataset using various data assimilation techniques depending upon the air-quality forecasting system used. In parallel, air quality forecasts are produced once a day for the next four days. Both the analysis and the forecast are available at hourly time steps at seven height levels.

CAMS_GAC_FORECAST,"CAMS produces global forecasts for atmospheric composition twice a day. The forecasts consist of more than 50 chemical species (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and seven different types of aerosol (desert dust, sea salt, organic matter, black carbon, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium aerosol). In addition, several meteorological variables are available as well. The initial conditions of each forecast are obtained by combining a previous forecast with current satellite observations through a process called data assimilation. This best estimate of the state of the atmosphere at the initial forecast time step, called the analysis, provides a globally complete and consistent dataset allowing for estimates at locations where observation data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The forecast itself uses a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry to determine the evolution of the concentrations of all species over time for the next five days. Apart from the required initial state, it also uses inventory-based or observation-based emission estimates as a boundary condition at the surface. The CAMS global forecasting system is upgraded about once a year resulting in technical and scientific changes. The horizontal or vertical resolution can change, new species can be added, and more generally the accuracy of the forecasts can be improved. Details of these system changes can be found in the documentation. Users looking for a more consistent long-term data set should consider using the CAMS Global Reanalysis instead, which is available through the ADS and spans the period from 2003 onwards. Finally, because some meteorological fields in the forecast do not fall within the general CAMS data licence, they are only available with a delay of 5 days.

The CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) utilises satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to provide near-real-time information on the location, relative intensity and estimated emissions from biomass burning and vegetation fires. Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions. Emissions estimates for 40 pyrogenic species are available from GFAS, including aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees longitude by 0.1 degrees latitude. This version of GFAS (v1.2) provides daily averaged data based on a combination of FRP observations from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, one on the NASA EOS-Terra satellite and the other on the NASA EOS-Aqua satellite from 1 January 2003 to present. GFAS also provides daily estimates of smoke plume injection heights derived from FRP observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts from ECMWF.

Natural and anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of the composition of the atmosphere, so an accurate representation of them in forecast models of atmospheric composition is essential. CAMS compiles inventories of emission data that serve as input to its own forecast models, but which can also be used by other atmospheric chemical transport models. These inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use on land, shipping, and aviation, and natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean and termites. The anthropogenic emissions on land are further separated in specific activity sectors (e.g., power generation, road traffic, industry). The CAMS emission data sets provide good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors. Because most inventory-based data sets are only available with a delay of several years, the CAMS emission inventories also extend these existing data sets forward in time by using the trends from the most recent available years, producing timely input data for real-time forecast models. Most of the data sets are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency, when needed.

CAMS_GREENHOUSE_INVERSION,"This data set contains net fluxes at the surface, atmospheric mixing ratios at model levels, and column-mean atmospheric mixing ratios for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). Natural and anthropogenic surface fluxes of greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of Earth's climate, so their monitoring is essential. Such information has been used in particular as part of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ground-based and satellite remote-sensing observations provide a means to quantifying the net fluxes between the land and ocean on the one hand and the atmosphere on the other hand. This is done through a process called atmospheric inversion, which uses transport models of the atmosphere to link the observed concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the net fluxes at the Earth's surface. By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades. For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields). The data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency.

CAMS_GRF,"This dataset provides geographical distributions of the radiative forcing (RF) by key atmospheric constituents. The radiative forcing estimates are based on the CAMS reanalysis and additional model simulations and are provided separately for CO2 CH4, O3 (tropospheric and stratospheric), interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and radiation and interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and clouds. Radiative forcing measures the imbalance in the Earth's energy budget caused by a perturbation of the climate system, such as changes in atmospheric composition caused by human activities. RF is a useful predictor of globally-averaged temperature change, especially when rapid adjustments of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are taken into account. RF has therefore become a quantitative metric to compare the potential climate response to different perturbations. Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the industrial era exerted a positive RF, causing a gain of energy in the climate system. In contrast, concurrent changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations are thought to exert a negative RF leading to a loss of energy. Products are quantified both in ""all-sky"" conditions, meaning that the radiative effects of clouds are included in the radiative transfer calculations, and in ""clear-sky"" conditions, which are computed by excluding clouds in the radiative transfer calculations. The upgrade from version 1.5 to 2 consists of an extension of the period by 2017-2018, the addition of an ""effective radiative forcing"" product and new ways to calculate the pre-industrial reference state for aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei. More details are given in the documentation section. New versions may be released in future as scientific methods develop, and existing versions may be extended with later years if data for the period is available from the CAMS reanalysis.

The calculation of aerosol radiative forcing requires a discrimination between aerosol of anthropogenic and natural origin.

CLMS_GLO_NDVI_1KM_LTS,"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a proxy to quantify the vegetation amount. It is defined as NDVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red) where NIR corresponds to the reflectance in the near infrared band, and Red to the reflectance in the red band. The time series of dekadal (10-daily) NDVI 1km version 2 observations over the period 1999-2017 is used to calculate Long Term Statistics (LTS) for each of the 36 10-daily periods (dekads) of the year. The calculated LTS include the minimum, median, maximum, average, standard deviation and the number of observations in the covered time series period. These LTS can be used as a reference for actual NDVI observations, which allows evaluating whether vegetation conditions deviate from a 'normal' situation.
