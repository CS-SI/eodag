For Stripmap mode, there are multiple spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette. The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes. The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated geometrical Doppler.
