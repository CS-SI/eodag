AG_ERA5,"This dataset provides daily surface meteorological data for the period from 1979 to present as input for agriculture and agro-ecological studies. This dataset is based on the hourly ECMWF ERA5 data at surface level and is referred to as AgERA5. Acquisition and pre-processing of the original ERA5 data is a complex and specialized job. By providing the AgERA5 dataset, users are freed from this work and can directly start with meaningful input for their analyses and modelling. To this end, the variables provided in this dataset match the input needs of most agriculture and agro-ecological models. Data were aggregated to daily time steps at the local time zone and corrected towards a finer topography at a 0.1° spatial resolution. The correction to the 0.1° grid was realized by applying grid and variable-specific regression equations to the ERA5 dataset interpolated at 0.1° grid. The equations were trained on ECMWF's operational high-resolution atmospheric model (HRES) at a 0.1° resolution. This way the data is tuned to the finer topography, finer land use pattern and finer land-sea delineation of the ECMWF HRES model.

CAMS_EAC4,"EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) is the fourth generation ECMWF global reanalysis of atmospheric composition. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. The assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates.

CAMS produces specific daily air quality analyses and forecasts for the European domain at significantly higher spatial resolution (0.1 degrees, approx. 10km) than is available from the global analyses and forecasts. The production is based on an ensemble of eleven air quality forecasting systems across Europe. A median ensemble is calculated from individual outputs, since ensemble products yield on average better performance than the individual model products. The spread between the eleven models are used to provide an estimate of the forecast uncertainty. The analysis combines model data with observations provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) into a complete and consistent dataset using various data assimilation techniques depending upon the air-quality forecasting system used. In parallel, air quality forecasts are produced once a day for the next four days. Both the analysis and the forecast are available at hourly time steps at seven height levels.

CAMS_GAC_FORECAST,"CAMS produces global forecasts for atmospheric composition twice a day. The forecasts consist of more than 50 chemical species (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and seven different types of aerosol (desert dust, sea salt, organic matter, black carbon, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium aerosol). In addition, several meteorological variables are available as well. The initial conditions of each forecast are obtained by combining a previous forecast with current satellite observations through a process called data assimilation. This best estimate of the state of the atmosphere at the initial forecast time step, called the analysis, provides a globally complete and consistent dataset allowing for estimates at locations where observation data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The forecast itself uses a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry to determine the evolution of the concentrations of all species over time for the next five days. Apart from the required initial state, it also uses inventory-based or observation-based emission estimates as a boundary condition at the surface. The CAMS global forecasting system is upgraded about once a year resulting in technical and scientific changes. The horizontal or vertical resolution can change, new species can be added, and more generally the accuracy of the forecasts can be improved. Details of these system changes can be found in the documentation. Users looking for a more consistent long-term data set should consider using the CAMS Global Reanalysis instead, which is available through the ADS and spans the period from 2003 onwards. Finally, because some meteorological fields in the forecast do not fall within the general CAMS data licence, they are only available with a delay of 5 days.

The CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) utilises satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to provide near-real-time information on the location, relative intensity and estimated emissions from biomass burning and vegetation fires. Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions. Emissions estimates for 40 pyrogenic species are available from GFAS, including aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees longitude by 0.1 degrees latitude. This version of GFAS (v1.2) provides daily averaged data based on a combination of FRP observations from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, one on the NASA EOS-Terra satellite and the other on the NASA EOS-Aqua satellite from 1 January 2003 to present. GFAS also provides daily estimates of smoke plume injection heights derived from FRP observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts from ECMWF.

Natural and anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of the composition of the atmosphere, so an accurate representation of them in forecast models of atmospheric composition is essential. CAMS compiles inventories of emission data that serve as input to its own forecast models, but which can also be used by other atmospheric chemical transport models. These inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use on land, shipping, and aviation, and natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean and termites. The anthropogenic emissions on land are further separated in specific activity sectors (e.g., power generation, road traffic, industry). The CAMS emission data sets provide good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors. Because most inventory-based data sets are only available with a delay of several years, the CAMS emission inventories also extend these existing data sets forward in time by using the trends from the most recent available years, producing timely input data for real-time forecast models. Most of the data sets are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency, when needed.

CAMS_GREENHOUSE_INVERSION,"This data set contains net fluxes at the surface, atmospheric mixing ratios at model levels, and column-mean atmospheric mixing ratios for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). Natural and anthropogenic surface fluxes of greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of Earth's climate, so their monitoring is essential. Such information has been used in particular as part of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ground-based and satellite remote-sensing observations provide a means to quantifying the net fluxes between the land and ocean on the one hand and the atmosphere on the other hand. This is done through a process called atmospheric inversion, which uses transport models of the atmosphere to link the observed concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the net fluxes at the Earth's surface. By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades. For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields). The data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency.

CAMS_GRF,"This dataset provides geographical distributions of the radiative forcing (RF) by key atmospheric constituents. The radiative forcing estimates are based on the CAMS reanalysis and additional model simulations and are provided separately for CO2 CH4, O3 (tropospheric and stratospheric), interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and radiation and interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and clouds. Radiative forcing measures the imbalance in the Earth's energy budget caused by a perturbation of the climate system, such as changes in atmospheric composition caused by human activities. RF is a useful predictor of globally-averaged temperature change, especially when rapid adjustments of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are taken into account. RF has therefore become a quantitative metric to compare the potential climate response to different perturbations. Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the industrial era exerted a positive RF, causing a gain of energy in the climate system. In contrast, concurrent changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations are thought to exert a negative RF leading to a loss of energy. Products are quantified both in ""all-sky"" conditions, meaning that the radiative effects of clouds are included in the radiative transfer calculations, and in ""clear-sky"" conditions, which are computed by excluding clouds in the radiative transfer calculations. The upgrade from version 1.5 to 2 consists of an extension of the period by 2017-2018, the addition of an ""effective radiative forcing"" product and new ways to calculate the pre-industrial reference state for aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei. More details are given in the documentation section. New versions may be released in future as scientific methods develop, and existing versions may be extended with later years if data for the period is available from the CAMS reanalysis.

The calculation of aerosol radiative forcing requires a discrimination between aerosol of anthropogenic and natural origin.

ERA5_LAND,"ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'. The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states.

ERA5_PL,"ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has not been the case and when this does occur users will be notified. The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications. An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines. Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).

ERA5_SL,"ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. Data is available from 1940 onwards. ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.

FIRE_SEASONAL,"This dataset offers modeled daily fire danger time series, driven by seasonal weather forecasts. It provides long-range predictions of meteorological conditions conducive to the initiation, spread, and persistence of fires. The fire danger metrics included in this dataset are part of an extensive dataset produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS). EFFIS and GWIS are used for monitoring and forecasting fire danger at both European and global scales. The dataset incorporates fire danger indices from the U.S. Forest Service National Fire-Danger Rating System (NFDRS), the Canadian Forest Service Fire Weather Index Rating System (FWI), and the Australian McArthur (Mark 5) rating systems. This dataset was generated by driving the Global ECMWF Fire Forecast (GEFF) model with seasonal weather ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 5 (SEAS5) prediction system.These forecasts initially consist of 25 ensemble members until December 2016, referred to as re-forecasts. After that period, they consist of seasonal forecasts with 51 members. It is important to note that the re-forecast dataset was initialized using ERA-Interim analysis data, while forecast simulations from 2016 onward are initialized using ECMWF operational analysis. Therefore, it is suggested that the period 1981-2016 be used as a reference period, while the period 2017-to present as a real time forecast. For both the re-forecast (1981-2016) and forecast periods (2017-present), the temporal resolution is daily forecasts at 12:00 local time, available once a month, with a prediction horizon of 216 days (equivalent to 7 months). The data records in this dataset will be extended over time as seasonal forcing data becomes available. Once the SEAS5 operation ceases, the dataset will be updated with the next ECMWF seasonal system (SEAS6). It is essential to note that this is not a real-time service, as real-time forecasts are accessible through the EFFIS web services. These seasonal forecasts can be used to assess the performance of the forecasting system or to develop tools for statistically correcting forecast errors.

GRIDDED_GLACIERS_MASS_CHANGE,"The dataset provides annual glacier mass changes distributed on a global regular grid at 0.5° resolution (latitude, longitude). Glaciers play a fundamental role in the Earth's water cycles. They are one of the most important freshwater resources for societies and ecosystems and the recent increase in ice melt contributes directly to the rise of ocean levels. Due to this they have been declared as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by GCOS, the Global Climate Observing System. Within the Copernicus Services, the global gridded annual glacier mass change dataset provides information on changing glacier resources by combining glacier change observations from the Fluctuations of Glaciers (FoG) database that is brokered from World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). Previous glacier products were provided to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS) as a homogenized state-of-the-art glacier dataset with separated elevation and mass change time series collected by scientists and the national correspondents of each country as provided to the WGMS (see Related data). The new approach combines glacier mass balances from in-situ observations with glacier elevation changes from remote sensing to generate a new gridded product of annual glacier mass changes and related uncertainties for every hydrological year since 1975/76 provided in a 0.5°x0.5° global regular grid. The dataset bridges the gap on spatio-temporal coverage of glacier change observations, providing for the first time in the CDS an annually resolved glacier mass change product using the glacier elevation change sample as calibration. This goal has become feasible at the global scale thanks to a new globally near-complete (96 percent of the world glaciers) dataset of glacier elevation change observations recently ingested by the FoG database. To develop the distributed glacier change product the glacier outlines were used from the Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0 (see Related data). A glacier is considered to belong to a grid-point when its geometric centroid lies within the grid point. The centroid is obtained from the glacier outlines from the Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0. The glacier mass changes in the unit Gigatonnes (1 Gt = 1x10^9 tonnes) correspond to the total mass of water lost/gained over the glacier surface during a given year. Note that to propagate to mm/cm/m of water column on the grid cell, the grid cell area needs to be considered. Also note that the data is provided for hydrological years, which vary between the Northern Hemisphere (01 October to 30 September next year) and the Southern Hemisphere (01 April to 31 March next year).

This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves. The global wave system of Météo-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project « my wave » (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10°. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in primary and secondary swells.

It contains AMV at all heights below the tropopause, derived from images in 2 channels (Water Vapour 6.2, Infrared 10.8) of the instrument MVIRI on board MFG and SEVIRI on board MSG. Vectors are retrieved by tracking the motion of clouds and other atmospheric constituents such as water vapour patterns. The height assignment of the AMVs is calculated using the Cross-Correlation Contribution (CCC) function to determine the height using the pixels that contribute the most to the vectors. The final vector is estimated averaging the speed and height over 4 consecutive images. A quality indicator is derived for each vector to assess the reliability of the retrieval. Products are stored in netCDF4 format and generated from Meteosat-2 to Meteosat-11 satellites, covering the period from September 1981 to August 2019. This is a Thematic Climate Data Record (TCDR).

MTG_LI_AF,LI Level 2 Accumulated Flashes (AF) complements the LI Level 2 Accumulated Flash Area (AFA) by providing one with the variation of the number of events within those regions reported to have lightning flashes in the Accumulated Flash Area (AFA). Accumulated Flashes provide users with data about the mapping of the number of LI events/detections rather than the mapping of flashes. One should keep in mind that the absolute value within each pixel of the Accumulated Flashes has no real physical meaning; it is rather a proxy for the pixel-by-pixel variation of the number of events. It is worth noting that one can derive the flash rate over a region encompassing a complete lightning feature (not within an FCI grid pixel) in Accumulated Flashes; this stems from the definition in Accumulated (gridded) data. ,LI,MTG,MTG,L2,"MTG,L2,LI,AF,Lightning,Weather,Flashes",Lightning Imager,other,LI Accumulated Flashes - MTG - 0 degree,2024-07-08T00:00:00Z,MTG_LI_AF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,available,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to keep in mind that each flash is treated as a flat (uniform) optical emission in this data. Accumulated Flash Area allows one to monitor the regions within a cloud top from which lightning-related optical emissions over 30 sec are emerging and accumulating and to know the number of flashes that were observed within the FCI grid pixels composing those regions. For example, from the Accumulated Flash Area, one can derive the flash rate for each pixel of the FCI 2km grid. This is a considerable improvement compared to the simple description of the flash using the variable flash_footprint available in Lightning Flashes.

Lightning Flashes and Lightning Groups contain two variables that provide the size of each group and flash in units of LI pixels, ie number_of_events and flash_footprint, respectively. To compute the exact physical size of a group/flash, users should use the information available in Ligthning Events Filtered. One can derive such a descriptor only by knowing which events compose a group/flash and employing the physical size of the projection of each event on the Earth's surface for the computation.

The definition of a flash is shared by LI and GLM; collections of groups that are correlated in space and time within the two windows of 330 milliseconds (temporal window) and 16.5km (space window), respectively. Even if the definition of a flash is not uniform among all lightning location systems, the simple fact that a flash is a collection of groups/strokes correlated in space and time somewhat mitigates the differences in the way different types of lightning sensors interpret different lightning processes. This makes flash datasets of different lightning location systems more comparable than group/stroke datasets.

LI groups provide users with information about the time-slicing imaging (over the LI acquisition time, ie one millisecond) of lightning optical emissions. When comparing LI groups with either GLM or ISS-LIS groups, users must consider the differences in design between instruments, such as integration time and spatial sampling/resolution. Both GLM and ISS-LIS acquire over two milliseconds. When observing the same storm, this difference in design can potentially create considerable differences in the total number of groups, as well as differences between the acquisition times of the groups. In addition, differences will be found also for the geolocation of groups. In general, the discrepancies mentioned above are expected to be of the order of a few milliseconds for the group time and of the order of a few kilometres for the group geolocation.

Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such it is important to continue the record of satellite-based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatio/temporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse modelling of sources and sinks. The output product consists of the retrieved methane column and a row vector referred to as the column averaging kernel A. The column averaging kernel describes how the retrieved column relates to the true profile and should be used in validation exercises (when possible) or use of the product in source/sink inverse modelling. The output product also contains altitude levels of the layer interfaces to which the column averaging kernel corresponds. Additional output for Level-2 data products: viewing geometry, precision of retrieved methane, residuals of the fit, quality flags (cloudiness, terrain roughness etc.) and retrieved albedo and aerosol properties. The latter properties are required for a posteriori filtering and for estimation of total retrieval error.

These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified.

It is listed as an Essential Climate Variable by the Global Climate Observing System. Sea ice concentration is defined as the fraction of the ocean surface in a pixel or grid cell that is covered with sea ice. It is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise the sea-ice cover. Other sea ice parameters include sea ice thickness, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.  The dataset consists of two products produced by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) with research & development from European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative projects (ESA CCI):  The Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record based on measurements from the following sensors: Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR; 1978-1987), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I; 1987-2006), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS; 2005 onward).

The Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record based on measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor (2002-2011) and its successor, AMSR2 (2012-2020). This product spans the 2002-2020 period and is not updated. In the following, it is referred to as the AMSR product. Note, that this product was first produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Phase 2 project (ESA CCI) and has been transferred to EUMETSAT OSI SAF since version 3.0. Both products are provided on the same polar projection with a grid resolution of 25 km. However, the AMSR product has a true spatial resolution (as resolved by the sensor) of about 15-25 km versus 30-60 km for the SSMIS product. Therefore, the AMSR product provides a much more detailed view of the sea ice cover than the SSMIS product, especially in the marginal ice zone, the transitional zone between open water and the dense sea ice pack. On the other hand, the clear strength of the SSMIS product is its more than 40-year long and consistent record with daily updates.  The two products share the same algorithm baseline, which is both a continuation of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF approach and a series of innovations contributed by ESA CCI activities. For both products, the underlying algorithm makes use of a combination of the same three temperature channels near 19 GHz and 37 GHz. The data also share a common data format, that allows expert users to revert some of the filtering steps and access the raw output of the SIC algorithms.

Other parameters include sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness, also available in the Climate Data Store. Sea ice edge and type are defined as follows: Sea ice edge classifies the sea surface into open water, open ice, and closed ice depending on the amount of sea ice present in each grid cell. This variable is provided for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Note that a sea ice concentration threshold of 30% is used to distinguish between open water and open ice, which differs from the 15% threshold commonly used for other sea ice products such as sea ice extent. Sea ice type classifies ice-covered areas into two categories based on the age of the sea ice: multiyear ice versus seasonal first-year ice. This variable is currently only available for the Northern Hemisphere and limited to the extended boreal winter months (mid-October through April). Sea ice type classification during summer is difficult due to the effect of melting at the ice surface which disturbs the passive microwave signature. Both sea ice products are based on measurements from the series of Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sensors and share the same algorithm baseline. However, sea ice edge makes use of two lower frequencies near 19 GHz and 37 GHz and a higher frequency near 90 GHz whereas sea ice type only uses the two lower frequencies. This dataset combines Climate Data Records (CDRs), which are intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to assess climate variability and change, and Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which provide regular temporal extensions to the CDRs and where consistency with the CDRs is expected but not extensively checked. For this dataset, both the CDR and ICDR parts of each product were generated using the same software and algorithms. The CDRs of sea ice edge and type currently extend from 25 October 1978 to 31 December 2020 whereas the corresponding ICDRs extend from January 2021 to present (with a 16-day latency behind real time). All data from the current release of the datasets (version 2.0) are Level-4 products, in which data gaps are filled by temporal and spatial interpolation. For product limitations and known issues, please consult the Product User Guide.

SATELLITE_SEA_ICE_THICKNESS,"This dataset provides monthly gridded data of sea ice thickness for the Arctic region based on satellite radar altimetry observations. Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth's energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice thickness is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice, alongside sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store. Satellite radar altimeters provide measurements of the sea ice freeboard, which is the difference between the height of the surface of sea ice and the surface of water in open leads (areas of open water within the sea ice). Because of the buoyancy of ice in water, typically about 90% of the ice thickness remains under water and thus the total ice thickness is about 10 times the freeboard. However, snow on top of sea ice changes this ratio and complicates the estimation of the ice thickness, requiring the use of auxiliary information about snow depth and density. The retrieval of ice thickness uses the narrow radar swath at the nadir of the satellite at full resolution of approximately 1-10 km and a point spacing of 300 meters. This Level-2 sea-ice thickness products (not provided here) is then gridded for a period of a month to obtain full coverage of a north polar grid at a resolution of 25 km. The algorithm used was developed as part of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) on Sea Ice. The data provided here are Level-3 Collated (L3C) products: they contain monthly gridded values from orbit data from a single platform (Envisat or CryoSat-2) without interpolation or any other form of gap filling. The files also contain estimates of the algorithm uncertainty as well as a quality status flag indicating potential issues with the retrieval not captured in the algorithm uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty in the algorithm are related to the auxiliary data and to the use of different radar altimeter concepts in Envisat (pulse-limited) and CryoSat-2 (synthetic aperture radar). This dataset combines a Climate Data Record (CDR), which has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and change, and an Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR), which provides regular temporal extensions to the CDR and where consistency with the CDR is expected but not extensively checked. Here, the CDR is based on measurements from the RA-2 altimeter on Envisat (October 2002 to October 2010) and the SIRAL altimeter on CryoSat-2 (November 2010 to April 2020). The ICDR is based on observations from CryoSat-2 only (from April 2015 onward) and is updated monthly with a one-month delay behind real time. Users should note that the quality and accuracy of the data record are higher during the CryoSat-2 period than during the Envisat period. As a result, care should be taken when combining the two missions to assess long-term changes and trends. More information can be found in the Product User Guide and Product Quality Assessment Report. This dataset is currently limited spatially to the Arctic region and temporally to the winter months of October through April due to unresolved bias originating from melting snow or open melt ponds in the remaining five months. For a similar reason, no sea-ice thickness data with sufficient quality exist for the Southern Hemisphere. The extension of the CDR/ICDR to other periods, regions, and radar altimeter missions is under development in the extension of the ESA CCI Sea Ice project (ESA CCI+).

SATELLITE_SEA_LEVEL_GLOBAL,"This data set provides gridded daily global estimates of sea level anomaly based on satellite altimetry measurements. The rise in global mean sea level in recent decades has been one of the most important and well-known consequences of climate warming, putting a large fraction of the world population and economic infrastructure at greater risk of flooding. However, changes in the global average sea level mask regional variations that can be one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, it is essential to measure changes in sea level over the world's oceans as accurately as possible. Sea level anomaly is defined as the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. In this dataset sea level anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012) using up-to-date altimeter standards. In the past, the altimeter sea level datasets were distributed on the CNES AVISO altimetry portal until their production was taken over by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The sea level data set provided here by C3S is climate-oriented, that is, dedicated to the monitoring of the long-term evolution of sea level and the analysis of the ocean/climate indicators, both requiring a homogeneous and stable sea level record. To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes. The C3S sea level data set is used to produce Ocean Monitoring Indicators (e.g. global and regional mean sea level evolution), available in the CMEMS catalogue. The CMEMS sea level dataset has a more operational focus as it is dedicated to the retrieval of mesoscale signals in the context of ocean modeling and analysis of the ocean circulation on a global or regional scale. Such applications require the most accurate sea level estimates at each time step with the best spatial sampling of the ocean with all satellites available, with less emphasis on long-term stability and homogeneity. This data set is updated three times a year with a delay of about 6 months relative to present time. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, these processing and validation steps are essential to enhance the stability and accuracy of the sea level products and make them suitable for climate applications. This dataset includes estimates of sea level anomaly and absolute dynamic topography together with the corresponding geostrophic velocities. More details about the sea level retrieval algorithms, additional filters, optimisation procedures, and the error estimation are given in the Documentation tab.

SEASONAL_MONTHLY_PL,"This entry covers pressure-level data aggregated on a monthly time resolution. \nSeasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks or months, as a result of predictable changes in some of the slow-varying components of the system. For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales.

UERRA_EUROPE_SL,"This UERRA dataset contains analyses of surface and near-surface essential climate variables from UERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX systems. Forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available only through the CDS-API (see Documentation). UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidit at 2 meters above the model topography. The land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows to take full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow. In general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in 1960s, will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates. The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.
