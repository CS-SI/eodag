It consists of an inventory of land cover in 44 classes. CLC uses a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 25 hectares (ha) for areal phenomena and a minimum width of 100 m for linear phenomena. The time series are complemented by change layers, which highlight changes in land cover with an MMU of 5 ha. Different MMUs mean that the change layer has higher resolution than the status layer. Due to differences in MMUs the difference between two status layers will not equal to the corresponding CLC-Changes layer. If you are interested in CLC-Changes between two neighbour surveys always use the CLC-Change layer.

This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance.

When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers.

EEA_DAILY_SSM_1KM,"Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is the relative water content of the top few centimetres soil, describing how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer, expressed in percent saturation. It is measured by satellite radar sensors and allows insights in local precipitation impacts and soil conditions. SSM is a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, regulating air temperature and humidity. Moreover, in its role as water supply, it is vital to vegetation health. Vice versa, SSM is very sensitive to external forcing in the form of precipitation, temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, and wind. SSM is thus both an integrator of climatic conditions and a driver of local weather and climate, and plays a major role in global water-, energy- and carbon- cycles.

ERA5_LAND,"ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'. The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting.

ERA5_LAND_MONTHLY,"ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land provides a consistent view of the water and energy cycles at surface level during several decades. It contains a detailed record from 1950 onwards, with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The native spatial resolution of the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset is 9km on a reduced Gaussian grid (TCo1279). The data in the CDS has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees. The data presented here is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset. Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to facilitate many applications requiring easy and fast access to the data, when sub-monthly fields are not required. Hourly fields can be found in the ERA5-Land hourly fields CDS page. Documentation can be found in the online ERA5-Land documentation.

ERA5_PL,"ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has not been the case and when this does occur users will be notified. The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications. An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines. Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).

Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such it is important to continue the record of satellite-based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatio/temporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse modelling of sources and sinks. The output product consists of the retrieved methane column and a row vector referred to as the column averaging kernel A. The column averaging kernel describes how the retrieved column relates to the true profile and should be used in validation exercises (when possible) or use of the product in source/sink inverse modelling. The output product also contains altitude levels of the layer interfaces to which the column averaging kernel corresponds. Additional output for Level-2 data products: viewing geometry, precision of retrieved methane, residuals of the fit, quality flags (cloudiness, terrain roughness etc.) and retrieved albedo and aerosol properties. The latter properties are required for a posteriori filtering and for estimation of total retrieval error.

This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, this processing and validation adds stability and accuracy to the sea level variables and make them adapted to climate applications. This dataset includes uncertainties for each grid cell. More details about the sea level retrieval, additional filters, optimisation procedures, and the error estimation are given in the Documentation section.

SEASONAL_MONTHLY_PL,"This entry covers pressure-level data aggregated on a monthly time resolution. \nSeasonal forecasts provide a long-range outlook of changes in the Earth system over periods of a few weeks or months, as a result of predictable changes in some of the slow-varying components of the system. For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. These models are initialised with data describing the state of the system at the starting point of the forecast, and used to predict the evolution of this state in time.\nWhile uncertainties coming from imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions of the components of the Earth system can be described with the use of ensembles, uncertainty arising from approximations made in the models are very much dependent on the choice of model. A convenient way to quantify the effect of these approximations is to combine outputs from several models, independently developed, initialised and operated.\nTo this effect, the C3S provides a multi-system seasonal forecast service, where data produced by state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems developed, implemented and operated at forecast centres in several European countries is collected, processed and combined to enable user-relevant applications.

SIS_HYDRO_MET_PROJ,"This dataset provides precipitation and near surface air temperature for Europe as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and as a set of Climate Impact Indicators (CIIs) based on the ECVs. \nECV datasets provide the empirical evidence needed to understand the current climate and predict future changes. \nCIIs contain condensed climate information which facilitate relatively quick and efficient subsequent analysis. Therefore, CIIs make climate information accessible to application focussed users within a sector.\nThe ECVs and CIIs provided here were derived within the water management sectoral information service to address questions specific to the water sector. However, the products are provided in a generic form and are relevant for a range of sectors, for example agriculture and energy.\nThe data represent the current state-of-the-art in Europe for regional climate modelling and indicator production. Data from eight model simulations included in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) were used to calculate a total of two ECVs and five CIIs at a spatial resolution of 0.11° x 0.11° and 5km x 5km.\nThe ECV data meet the technical specification set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), as such they are provided on a daily time step. They are bias adjusted using the EFAS gridded observations as a reference dataset. Note these are model output data, not observation data as is the general case for ECVs.\nThe CIIs are provided as mean values over a 30-year time period. For the reference period (1971-2000) data is provided as absolute values, for the future periods the data is provided as absolute values and as the relative or absolute change from the reference period. The future periods cover 3 fixed time periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100) and 3 \""degree scenario\"" periods defined by when global warming exceeds a given threshold (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C or 3.0 °C).

UERRA_EUROPE_SL,"This UERRA dataset contains analyses of surface and near-surface essential climate variables from UERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX systems. Forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available only through the CDS-API (see Documentation). UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidit at 2 meters above the model topography. The land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows to take full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow. In general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in 1960s, will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates. The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.
