For Stripmap mode, there are multiple spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette. The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes. The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated geometrical Doppler.

S5P_L2_CH4,"Methane (CH4) is, after carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important contributor to the anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse effect. Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such it is important to continue the record of satellite-based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatio/temporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse modelling of sources and sinks. The output product consists of the retrieved methane column and a row vector referred to as the column averaging kernel A. The column averaging kernel describes how the retrieved column relates to the true profile and should be used in validation exercises (when possible) or use of the product in source/sink inverse modelling. The output product also contains altitude levels of the layer interfaces to which the column averaging kernel corresponds. Additional output for Level-2 data products: viewing geometry, precision of retrieved methane, residuals of the fit, quality flags (cloudiness, terrain roughness etc.) and retrieved albedo and aerosol properties. The latter properties are required for a posteriori filtering and for estimation of total retrieval error. The Sentinel-5 Precursor mission flies in loose formation (about 3.5 - 5 minutes behind) with the S-NPP (SUOMI-National Polar-orbiting Partnership) mission to use VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) cloud information to select cloud free TROPOMI pixels for high quality methane retrieval.

S5P_L2_HCHO,"Formaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), leading eventually to CO2. NMVOCs are, together with NOx, CO and CH4, among the most important precursors of tropospheric O3. The major HCHO source in the remote atmosphere is CH4 oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important and localised enhancements of the HCHO levels. In addition to the main product results, such as HCHO slant column, vertical column and air mass factor, the level 2 data files contain several additional parameters and diagnostic information.

S5P_L2_NP_BD3,"S5P-NPP Cloud for spectral band 3. The S5P level 2 methane product is dependent on having information on cloud occurrence at spatial resolution finer than that achievable from TROPOMI itself. This information is also useful for other purposes, including assessing the influence of cloud on other L2 products and issues related to spatial co-registration. A level 2 auxiliary product was therefore developed to describe cloud in the TROPOMI field of view (FOV), using co-located observations of VIIRS (Visible Infra-red Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the U.S. S-NPP (Suomi - National Polar-orbiting Partnership). S5P flies in a so-called loose formation with the S-NPP with a temporal separation between them of less than 5 minutes. The main information contained in the S5P-NPP product is: 1. A statistical summary for each S5P FOV of the NPP-VIIRS L2 Cloud Mask (VCM). 2. The mean and standard deviation of the sun-normalised radiance in a number of VIIRS moderate resolution bands. This information is provided for three S5P spectral bands (to account for differences in spatial sampling).

S5P_L2_O3,"Ozone (O3) is of crucial importance for the equilibrium of the Earth's atmosphere. In the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous solar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient cleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the health of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important greenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change. These products are provided in NetCDF-CF format and contain total ozone, ozone temperature, and error information including averaging kernels.

S5P_L2_O3_PR,"Retrieved ozone profiles are used to monitor the evolution of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. Such monitoring is important as the ozone layer protects life on Earth against harmful UV radiation. The ozone layer is recovering from depletion due to manmade Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Tropospheric ozone is toxic and it plays an important role in tropospheric chemistry. Also, ozone is a greenhouse gas and is therefore also relevant for climate change. The main parameters in the file are the retrieved ozone profile at 33 levels and the retrieved sub-columns of ozone in 6 layers. In addition, the total ozone column and tropospheric ozone columns are provided. For the ozone profile, the precision and smoothing errors, the a-priori profile and the averaging kernel are also provided.

S5P_L2_O3_TCL,"Ozone in the tropical troposphere plays various important roles. The intense UV radiation and high humidity in the tropics stimulate the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH) by the photolysis of ozone. OH is the most important oxidant in the troposphere because it reacts with virtually all trace gases, such as CO, CH4 and other hydrocarbons. The tropics are also characterized by large emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons, both from natural and anthropogenic sources. Ozone that is formed over regions where large amounts of these ozone precursors are emitted, can be transported over great distances and affects areas far from the source. The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product is a level-2c product that represents three day averaged tropospheric ozone columns on a 0.5° by 1° latitude-longitude grid for the tropical region between 20°N and 20°S. The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level-2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as input.

S5P_L2_SO2,"Sulphur dioxide (SO2) enters the Earth's atmosphere through both natural (~30%) and anthropogenic processes (~70%). It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global scale and its impact ranges from short term pollution to effects on climate. Beside the total column of SO2, enhanced levels of SO2 are flagged within the products. The recognition of enhanced SO2 values is essential in order to detect and monitor volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic pollution sources. Volcanic SO2 emissions may also pose a threat to aviation, along with volcanic ash.
