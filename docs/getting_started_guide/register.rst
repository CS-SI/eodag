.. _register:

Provider registration
=====================

The providers usually require their user to register to their service. As a result,
the users obtain a set of credentials (e.g. login/password, API key, etc.). These credentials
need to be provided to ``eodag`` (see :ref:`configure`). The list below explains how to register
to each provider supported by ``eodag``:

[AWS] ``astraea_eod``, ``earth_search``, ``usgs_satapi_aws``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need AWS credentials for download:

* Create an account on `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__
* Once the account is activated go to the `identity access management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home>`__
* Click on user, then on your user name and then on security credentials.
* In access keys, click on create access key.
* Add these credentials to the user configuration file.

.. warning::

    A credit card number must be provided when creating an AWS account because fees apply
    after a given amount of downloaded data.

``aws_eos``
^^^^^^^^^^^
You need credentials for both EOS (search) and AWS (download):

* Create an account on `EOS <https://auth.eos.com>`__
* Get your EOS api key from `here <https://api-connect.eos.com/user-dashboard/statistics>`__
* Create an account on `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__
* Once the account is activated go to the `identity access management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home>`__
* Click on user, then on your user name and then on security credentials.
* In access keys, click on create access key.
* Add these credentials to the user configuration file:

  * ``search_auth.credentials.api_key``

``wekeo_main``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need an access token to authenticate and to accept terms and conditions with it:

* Create an account on `WEkEO <https://www.wekeo.eu/register>`__
* Add your WEkEO credentials (*username*, *password*) to the user configuration file.
* Depending on which data you want to retrieve, you will then need to accept terms and conditions (for once). To do this, follow the
  `tutorial guidelines <https://eodag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutos/tuto_wekeo.html#Registration>`__
  or run the following commands in your terminal.
* First, get a token from your base64-encoded credentials (replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your credentials):

  .. code-block:: bash

    curl -X POST --data '{"username": "USERNAME", "password": "PASSWORD"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://gateway.prod.wekeo2.eu/hda-broker/gettoken"

  The WEkEO API will respond with a token:

  .. code-block:: bash

    { "access_token": "xxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy",
      "refresh_token": "xxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy",
      "scope":"openid",
      "id_token":"token",
      "token_type":"Bearer",
      "expires_in":3600
    }

* Accept terms and conditions by running this command and replacing <access_token> and <licence_name>:

  .. code-block:: bash

    curl --request PUT --header 'accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' https://gateway.prod.wekeo2.eu/hda-broker/api/v1/termsaccepted/<licence_name>

  The licence name depends on which data you want to retrieve. To use all datasets available in wekeo, the following licences have to be accepted:

  * EUMETSAT_Copernicus_Data_Licence
  * Copernicus_Land_Monitoring_Service_Data_Policy
  * Copernicus_Sentinel_License
  * Copernicus_ECMWF_License
  * Copernicus_DEM_Instance_COP-DEM-GLO-30-F_Global_30m
  * Copernicus_DEM_Instance_COP-DEM-GLO-90-F_Global_90m
