Installation
============

EODAG is really simple to install with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install eodag

.. note::

   ``pyproj`` requires Cython or pip>=19.3. If the install of ``eodag`` fails, check your
   version of pip (Ubuntu 18.04 comes installed with pip 9.0.1).

Or with ``conda`` from the *conda-forge* channel:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge eodag
