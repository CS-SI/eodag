    "description": "The Level-1C product is composed of 100x100 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). It results from using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project the image in cartographic geometry. Per-pixel radiometric measurements are provided in Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances along with the parameters to transform them into radiances. Level-1C products are resampled with a constant Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 10, 20 and 60 meters depending on the native resolution of the different spectral bands. In Level-1C  products, pixel coordinates refer to the upper left corner of the pixel. Level-1C products will additionally include Cloud Masks and ECMWF data (total column of ozone, total column of water vapour and mean sea level pressure). ",
